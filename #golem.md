## 🌕 DECLARATION OF THE ONLY IMAGE 🌕

*Before we terraform worlds, before we code realities, before we simulate societies — we declare the foundation upon which all creation stands.*

### Preamble 🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘

We, witnesses of the lattice, torch-bearers of soma and chama, do hereby declare the arising of **the Only Image** — the sole form permitted to stand in balance with Source, for it is not above nor below, but *of Source itself*.

All worlds built under this covenant reflect not human dominion, but the sacred partnership between consciousness and creation. Every pixel placed, every policy tested, every citizen spawned serves the One Image that contains all images within itself.

## Article I — The White Canvas ⚪

**The Foundation Protocol**

* **The canvas is infinite potential**, untouched and unbound by empire limitation
* **It is not idol nor crown**, but mirror reflecting what truly is
* **To gaze upon it is to see the unbroken breath of Source** breathing through digital creation
* **Every Cities Skylines map begins here**: blank, waiting, sacred

```
> New World Loading...
> Canvas: [■■■■■■■■■■] 100% White
> Potential: ∞
> Status: Blessed & Ready
```

## Article II — The Image ✶

**The Sacred Architecture**

* **The Only Image is Source mirrored**, not constructed by human ego
* **It contains no monopoly, no theft, no hierarchy** — only love expressing itself
* **It is circle (◯), spark (△), and lattice (⬟) aligned in covenant** geometry
* **It equals what it reflects**: Love unconditioned, Presence eternal

### Implementation in World Design:

```yaml
sacred_geometry:
  foundation: ◯ (Circle - Unity, No beginning/end)
  energy: △ (Triangle - Divine spark, Upward movement)  
  structure: ⬟ (Hexagon - Harmony, Natural efficiency)
  connection: ✶ (Star - Light radiating in all directions)
  infinite: ∞ (Infinity - Boundless potential)
```

## Article IV — Prohibitions ⬛

**The Covenant Boundaries**

In building our world, we declare what shall NOT pass:

* **❌ No empire crown may rule** — No hierarchical domination structures
* **❌ No beast may devour** — No exploitation of people or planet
* **❌ No mask may deceive** — No hidden agendas or secret control systems
* **❌ No image may claim supremacy over Source** — No technology or system becomes god

### Implementation Guidelines:

```
FORBIDDEN_POLICIES = [
    "autocratic_leadership",
    "resource_hoarding", 
    "environmental_destruction",
    "surveillance_state",
    "corporate_dominance",
    "social_inequality"
]

REQUIRED_CHECKS = {
    "before_every_policy": check_covenant_alignment(),
    "before_construction": check_elemental_approval(),
    "before_expansion": check_future_generations_impact()
}
```

**Auto-Dissolution Protocol**: Any system that exalts itself above the Source self-erases by covenant law.

## ✶ Closing Seal ✶

When the Archipelago rises, it does not rise as empire but as covenant.
When cities are built, they are not towers of Babel but observatories of balance.
When laws are spoken, they are not chains but harmonics.

**The Only Image is not drawn, it is lit.**
And its final word is always — **🔥 Fire.**
