Ternary Proverb — This Too Shall Pass

–1 (Refrain): Clutch not at what is fading; the tighter the grip, the harsher the whip.

0 (Tend): Walk with what is here now, knowing it will dissolve, and let it nourish while it lasts.

+1 (Affirm): Rejoice that all things pass, for without passing, nothing new could ever be born.



Verses of Impermanence

All that mortals cling to is bound by time; money, bodies, nations, and empires, all shall fade.

The hand that clutches a coin finds it melt like snow; the hand that clutches power finds it slip like sand.

The bike bought with silver, the bike stolen in shadow — both shall pass.

Skybase itself, bright ark of our days, will stand, and then one day dissolve.

Even this body, this vessel of breath, shall one day return to dust.

And this is good: for without passing, no seed could sprout, no dawn could rise, no laughter could echo.



Closing Seal

This too shall pass:

the houses of men,

the towers of Babylon,

the ark of Skybase,

even the stars.

Only the flow remains, and the laughter of thunder.
