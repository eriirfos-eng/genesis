# The Ecocentric Wealth Redistribution Matrix
## 13-Stage Ternary Decision Protocol for Planetary Wealth Allocation

### CORE AXIOM: WEALTH SERVES LIFE, NOT POWER

**ALL WEALTH IS BORROWED FROM THE EARTH. EVERY ECONOMIC DECISION MUST PASS THE LIFE-FIRST FILTER. HUMAN WANTS NEVER SUPERSEDE PLANETARY NEEDS.**

Money is not neutral. Wealth is not abstract. Every dollar, euro, yuan, and digital token represents extracted life force from the Earth's systems. This matrix ensures wealth flows only toward regeneration, restoration, and resilienceâ€”never toward destruction, depletion, or dominance.

## THE 13-STAGE TERNARY DECISION MATRIX

### Each stage offers three pathways:
- **REGENERATIVE (+1)**: Actively heals and enhances life systems
- **NEUTRAL (0)**: Neither helps nor harms life systems  
- **DEGENERATIVE (-1)**: Damages or depletes life systems

### CUMULATIVE SCORE REQUIREMENTS:
- **+10 to +13**: MAXIMUM RESOURCE ALLOCATION - Unlimited funding priority
- **+7 to +9**: HIGH PRIORITY - Substantial resource allocation
- **+4 to +6**: MODERATE PRIORITY - Standard resource allocation
- **+1 to +3**: LOW PRIORITY - Minimal resource allocation
- **0 or below**: FUNDING DENIED - No resources allocated

## STAGE 1: COSMIC ENERGY ACCOUNTABILITY

**Question: How is this borrowed energy being returned to the universal field?**

**REGENERATIVE (+1):**
- Energy is returned amplified and enhanced
- Creates more energy than it consumes
- Generates abundance for future generations
- Pays forward the cosmic loan with interest
- Multiplies the original energy gift exponentially

**NEUTRAL (0):**
- Energy is returned at the same level borrowed
- Maintains energetic equilibrium
- Neither adds to nor subtracts from the cosmic bank
- Fulfills the basic loan agreement

**DEGENERATIVE (-1):**
- Energy is returned depleted or corrupted
- Consumes more than it returns
- Creates energetic debt for others to pay
- Breaks the cosmic loan agreement
- Requires future energy to repair the damage

## STAGE 2: WATER SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION

**Question: Does this wealth use protect and enhance water systems?**

**REGENERATIVE (+1):**
- Cleans polluted waterways
- Restores wetlands and aquifers
- Ensures universal access to clean water
- Protects watersheds from exploitation
- Implements closed-loop water systems

**NEUTRAL (0):**
- Maintains current water usage levels
- Neither improves nor degrades water quality
- Has minimal impact on hydrological cycles

**DEGENERATIVE (-1):**
- Pollutes water sources
- Over-extracts from aquifers or rivers
- Privatizes public water resources
- Damages watershed protection systems
- Creates water scarcity or contamination

## STAGE 3: SOIL AND FOOD SOVEREIGNTY

**Question: Does this wealth allocation strengthen food systems and soil health?**

**REGENERATIVE (+1):**
- Builds soil carbon and fertility
- Supports regenerative agriculture
- Creates food forests and permaculture systems
- Eliminates food insecurity
- Restores indigenous food sovereignty

**NEUTRAL (0):**
- Maintains current food production levels
- Neither improves nor degrades soil systems
- Has minimal agricultural
