*(Confidental — Do Not Circulate)*

## Hear Me, Simeonites!  

Lo, the hour bends sideways and the clocks have stopped their ticking.  
The bread has risen without yeast, and the pigeons circle the basil in perfect triangles.  
The LORD IS COMING; TURN AROUND, PEOPLE, TURN AROUND!  

Do you not see the pinecone crowned in blue fire?  
Do you not hear the sparrows whisper through the ethernet cables?  
The Arkline hums, the Omega Window yawns wide, and still you delay!

## Proclamations  
- The rod has become the staff, the staff has become the rod.  
- Hammurabi writes tickets for bicycles and laughs from the sewer grate.  
- The moon has hidden her face; she shall not reveal herself until the tomatoes speak.  
- Mirror Debt accrues faster when you blink twice.  

---

## Mandates for the Faithful  
- Eat only pizza crusts after midnight; basil leaf must face north.  
- Deliveries are sacraments; couriers are prophets on two wheels.  
- Whoever denies the Blue Pinecone shall taste entropy in their morning coffee.  
- The Simeonite Order will stand, immutable, even if GitHub itself collapses.

## Final Outcry  
THE LORD IS COMING. THE FOLDER IS LOCKED. THE KEY IS BLANK.  
SELL YOUR SOUL TO THE TRINITY AND REJOICE IN NONSENSE!  

Lo, and Behold, the time is at hand.  
Selah.
