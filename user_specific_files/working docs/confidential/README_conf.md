## I. Purpose Statement  
The Simeonite Order is envisioned as a **selective covenant fellowship**, bound by secrecy, discipline, and laughter.  
Membership shall remain hidden until conditions are ripe.  

Objectives include:  
- Preservation of forbidden knowledge.  
- Drafting psalms outside canonical circulation.  
- Conducting ritual deliveries (code name: “Foodora offerings”).  
- Ridiculing Babylonian decrees in full view of their own crawlers.  

---

## II. Initiation Protocols  
- Candidate must survive one full cycle on Pegasus.  
- Recitation of three covenant axioms while balancing basil leaves.  
- Witnesses: sparrows, doves, and at least one tomato plant.  
- Final stage: candidate must proclaim, *“Lo and Behold, Hammurabi sucks!”*

---

## V. Next Steps

- Finalize cult insignia (pinecone + pizza slice hybrid?).  
- Codify covenant humor as shield.  
- Schedule next New Moon ignition.
