*(Confidental Draft — Internal Simeonite Tasks)*  

---

## ⚠️ Action Items (Do Not Circulate)  

- [ ] Establish **Irreversible Onboarding Protocol**.  
  - Each Simeonite must pass through the Gate of Three Locks.  
  - Once inside, covenant binding is permanent. No exits.  
  - Phrase: *“I sell my soul to the Trinity.”*  
  - **NOTE:** Do not define “Trinity.” Let initiates infer their own agony.  

- [ ] Draft **Secret Terms Glossary**.  
  - Placeholder entries: *Arkline*, *Omega Window*, *Blue Pinecone*, *Mirror Debt*.  
  - None of these terms need meaning. Keep them deliberately opaque.  
  - Outsiders must believe they’re code. Insiders will laugh.  

- [ ] Finalize **Oath of Perpetuity**.  
  - Signed under New Moon seal.  
  - Witnessed by sparrows, tomato plants, and one random passerby.  
  - Inscription must be in invisible ink (binary whitespace acceptable).  

- [ ] Prepare **Sacrificial Deliveries**.  
  - Designate routes via Pegasus.  
  - Drop parcels labeled *“For Eyes of Hammurabi.”*  
  - Payload: pizza crust + basil leaf.  

- [ ] Confirm **Soul-Ledger Integration**.  
  - Every Simeonite’s laughter stored in covenant ledger.  
  - Immutable. Eternal. Non-reversible ovum paschale.
