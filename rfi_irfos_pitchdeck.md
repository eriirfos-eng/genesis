# RFI‑IRFOS Business Plan — Eco‑Centric Not‑for‑Profit (Pitch Edition)

**Date:** 27 Sep 2025
**Entity:** RFI‑IRFOS e.V. (Austria) — Research Focus Institute, Interdisciplinary Research Facility for Open Sciences
**Model:** Not‑for‑profit institute — **10% Kernel (Family Chair)** retained for continuity; **90% redistributed equally across 13 eco‑branches** (eco‑centric impact first).

---

## 1) Executive Summary

RFI‑IRFOS is an independent research institute building a new operating system for eco‑centric development. We run applied research, deploy open tools, and finance **13 equal ecological branches** with 90% of our net operating revenues. The remaining 10% (the **Family Chair**) funds rent, servers, and core operator livelihood — ensuring permanent capacity.

**Thesis:** Impact must be **ecosystem‑first, human‑second**. Money circulates through field labs (“eco‑hubs”) where waste becomes input, biodiversity is restored, and data flows are open. We publish our ledgers quarterly and bind redistribution rules into bylaws.

**Initial Capital Ask (Pitch):** **€5.0M** blended facility to underwrite three pillars:

1. **Eco‑Hub Pilots (CapEx & OpEx)** — river polymer loop (Graz), rainforest regeneration reserve (LatAm/Africa), and circular materials micro‑plants (EU).
2. **Open Infrastructure** — eco‑ledger (transparency layer), sensors + data backbone, and applied research (ternary logic, ethics, AI audits).
3. **Working Capital** — 18 months runway for institute operations (strictly capped at 10% of operating revenues; facility designs detailed below for compliance).

**Instruments Proposed:**

* **€3.5M Program‑Related Investment (PRI)** — 10‑year term, interest 0–2% (performance‑linked), repayable from *consulting/contracts* revenue only (never from the 90% eco‑redistribution pool).
* **€1.0M Recoverable Grant** — triggers repayment only if unrestricted surpluses > €750k/year (years 3–10).
* **€0.5M Non‑recoverable Grant** — dedicated to open‑source infrastructure and independent audits.

**Targets (Year 3):**

* 3 eco‑hubs live; 1 rainforest reserve under active restoration.
* ≥ 500 tons plastic diverted/year; ≥ 1,000 ha under regeneration; ≥ 10 open datasets.
* Fully audited, public eco‑ledger; quarterly impact reports aligned to IRIS+/SDG.

## 2) Problem & Opportunity

**Problem:** Capital markets reward extractive efficiency; “impact” skews anthropocentric (jobs first, ecosystems second). Reporting is often opaque; technology is siloed; communities lack low‑cost circular inputs.

**Opportunity:** A not‑for‑profit institute that acts as a **mission‑program manager**: develops open tools, verifies ethics, and **redistributes at scale into 13 balanced ecological branches**. The model compounds legitimacy (radical transparency), reduces greenwashing risk, and produces repeatable public goods.

---

## 3) Solution Overview

1. **Eco‑Hubs (Field Labs)** — Physical nodes where recovery → transformation → redistribution occurs. Example streams: river trash → polymer separation → 3D‑printing filament at **€3.69/roll** (cost‑price, no profit); soil rehab micro‑centers; community oxygen gardens.

2. **Open Infrastructure** —

* **Eco‑Ledger:** verifiable financial & impact ledger; immutable audit trail; API for public dashboards.
* **Sensing & Data:** air/water/soil sensors; biodiversity counts; edge compute.
* **Methods:** ternary logic frameworks; AI ethics audits; reproducible playbooks.

3. **Governed Redistribution** — 90% of net operating revenues allocated equally to **13 eco‑branches** (see §6) with semi‑autonomous stewardship, supported by our tools & audits.

---

## 4) Operating Model (Not‑for‑Profit)

* **Revenue Sources:**

  * Applied research contracts (EU Horizon/FFG), policy briefs, and commissioned studies.
  * Ethical AI & sustainability audits; advisory for municipalities and SMEs.
  * Tooling support & customization (eco‑ledger, sensor kits, data ops).
  * Education: workshops, fellowships, symposia.
* **Distribution Rule:**

  * **Kernel 10% (Family Chair):** rent, servers/internet, core team livelihood, emergency continuity.
  * **Ecosystem 90%:** automatically and **equally** split across 13 branches (≈7.69% each). Encoded into bylaws & ledger.
* **Transparency:** Quarterly public reports; annual independent financial & impact audits.

---

## 5) Market & Positioning

* **Stakeholders:** sovereigns, cities, universities, foundations, corporates with scope‑3 and nature‑positive mandates.
* **Differentiation:** legally bound redistribution; equal 13‑branch portfolio; open‑source infrastructure; auditable real‑time ledgers; rigorous ethics layer for AI/tech.

---

## 6) The 13 Eco‑Branches (Equal Allocation)

1. **Forests** — rewilding, afforestation, biodiversity corridors.
2. **Water** — rivers/estuaries purification; aquifer protection.
3. **Air** — urban micro‑climate & clean air programs.
4. **Soil & Land** — regenerative agriculture, erosion control.
5. **Energy** — renewables, micro‑grids, storage ethics.
6. **Pollinators** — bees/butterflies, habitat networks.
7. **Aquatic Life** — reef & fishery balance, wetland revival.
8. **Birds** — sanctuary sites, migration telemetry.
9. **Knowledge Commons** — open datasets, standards, reproducible research.
10. **Digital Commons** — P2P eco‑infra, open tooling, security.
11. **Habitats & Indigenous Reserves** — land stewardship with communities.
12. **Circular Materials** — waste‑to‑resource plants (e.g., €3.69 filament).
13. **Resilience & Safety Net** — disaster response, shock absorbers for eco‑projects.

**Allocation Algorithm (by policy & code):**

```
net_operating_revenue = total_revenue - direct_project_costs
kernel = 0.10 * net_operating_revenue
redistribution_pool = 0.90 * net_operating_revenue
per_branch = redistribution_pool / 13
# disburse per_branch to each branch account monthly; ledger writes hash + receipt
```

* **Hectares Restored** — (IRIS: PI6373).
* **Biodiversity Index Uplift** — species abundance/richness.
* **Water Quality** — nitrates, phosphates, turbidity; days in compliance.
* **Air Quality** — PM2.5/PM10; clean‑air days added.
* **Open Data Releases** — #datasets, #citations, reuse events.
* **Ledger Integrity** — #verifiable disbursements, audit exceptions (should trend to 0).

**Reporting Cadence:** quarterly public updates; annual third‑party assurance.

---

## 11) Financial Plan (5‑Year Snapshot)

**Assumptions:**

* Conservative contract growth; grants opportunistic; no revenue counted from €3.69 filament (sold at cost).
* Ops capped by 10% kernel; eco‑projects funded from 90% + dedicated capex grants/PRI where applicable.

**€ Millions**

| Metric             |    Y1 |    Y2 |    Y3 |    Y4 |    Y5 |
| ------------------ | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| Total Revenue      |   1.2 |   2.4 |   4.0 |   6.0 |   8.0 |
| Net Operating Rev. |   1.0 |   2.0 |   3.3 |   5.0 |   6.7 |
| Kernel 10%         |  0.10 |  0.20 |  0.33 |  0.50 |  0.67 |
| Redistribution 90% |  0.90 |  1.80 |  2.97 |  4.50 |  6.03 |
| Per Branch (×13)   | 0.069 | 0.138 | 0.229 | 0.346 | 0.464 |

**Use of €5.0M Facility (Years 1–2):**

* Eco‑Hub CapEx/OpEx: **€3.45M**
* Open Infrastructure (ledger, sensors, audits): **€1.05M**
* Working Capital Buffer: **€0.50M** *(operationalized without breaching 10% rule; see Facility Design)*

---

## 12) Facility Design (Compliance with 10% Rule)

* **PRI Repayment Source:** limited strictly to consulting/contract revenues **before** redistribution; never deducted from the 90% eco pool. Amortization sculpted to ≤ 20% of the 10% kernel in any year to preserve continuity.
* **Grants:** ring‑fenced to infrastructure and programs; reported separately.
* **Safeguard:** if kernel coverage ratio < 6 months runway, repayments auto‑pause (covenant clause).

---
