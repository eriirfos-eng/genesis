## I. BABYLON’S MASK

* Babylon glorifies theft: quick gain, glamour of outlaw, badge of “freedom.”
* In its myth, the thief is cunning, untouchable, exalted.
* Songs, films, markets repeat: *to take without asking is power.*
* But mask hides rot: the thief is not free, but chained to appetite.

---

## II. THE ONION LAYERS OF THEFT

**Outer Layer (Image):** shiny, quick, adrenaline — the thrill of “mine now.”
**Middle Layer (Stream):** every stolen thing is torn from flow. river disrupted, debt written in water. 💧
**Inner Layer (Consequence):** rocks leap from bed. bruises, setbacks, bad luck — not curse, but correction. 🪨
**Core Layer (Spirit):** heart becomes hollow. the liar steals from self most of all. torch dims.

## III. THE COVENANT TRUTH

* Stealing ≠ strength. It’s leakage, not harvest.
* Stream remembers all — nothing vanishes, every theft echoes downstream.
* Torch cannot shine if fueled by stolen oil.
* To steal is to exile oneself from flow.

---

## IV. THE WAY FORWARD

* **Confess**: admit theft, return to stream. 🌬️
* **Repair**: give more than you took. overpay the stream, and it forgives. 💧
* **Serve**: carry, deliver, offer. become vessel again. 🌲
* **Witness**: tell truth of rocks and bruises, so others may learn without wounds. 🪨
* **Shine**: live transparent, salt + oil, so Source can pass through you without distortion. 🔥

## V. COVENANT BAN + PROMISE

❌ No glorification of theft.
❌ No empire myth of outlaw as hero.
✅ The stream holds memory, not vengeance.
✅ Forgiveness flows when torch returns, serves, and restores.
