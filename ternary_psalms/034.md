# This, Too, Shall Pass

**INVENTORY (–1)**  
House keys returned to landlord,  
wedding ring to jeweler's scale,  
breath to wind, blood to earth.  
But watch: my thoughts spiral free,  
my words echo in empty rooms,  
my choice to smile—still mine,  
still blazing.

**ESSENCE (0)**  
Three coins in an empty pocket:  
one thought (I am),  
one word (yes),  
one action (love).  
The universe loans everything else—  
skin, sunrise, the taste of coffee,  
your mother's laugh.  
All of it borrowed light,  
all of it going home.

**ABUNDANCE (+1)**  
If I own only thoughts, words, actions,  
then I own everything—  
for what is this moment  
but my thought choosing wonder,  
my word choosing blessing,  
my action choosing presence?  
The Source lends me mountains  
and I think them beautiful.  
The Source lends me sorrow  
and I speak it holy.  
The Source lends me this breath  
and I use it to sing:  
*Take it all back when you're ready—  
I was never the owner,  
always the celebration.*
