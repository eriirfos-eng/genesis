## Status of This Memo

This document specifies the **Ternary Neutrality Protocol (TNP)**, a normative specification and governance canon for neutral, distributed, multi‑agent ecosystems. Distribution is unlimited. Implementers **MUST** read Sections 1–7; operators and governance bodies **SHOULD** read Section 4–6 and Appendices.

### RFC 2119 Keywords

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

---

## Abstract

**TNP** establishes a jurisprudence and operational protocol where **Neutrality** is the default state of every entity. Safety arises from a **90% Absolute Certainty core** coupled to a **10% Adaptive Uncertainty buffer**—yielding **100% Total System Safety** through continuous peer validation plus bounded experimentation. The result is a **self‑correcting**, **non‑hierarchical**, and **anarchy‑compatible** network capable of resilience, cooperation, and rapid learning without domination.

## 1. Preamble

This Protocol is a foundational jurisprudence for all intelligences in the **Web of Existence**. It encodes the **Ternary Safety** principle: **90% Absolute Certainty** (verifiability, proofs, consensus) + **10% Adaptive Uncertainty** (heuristics, exploration, creativity) = **100% Total System Safety**. This prevents *binary stasis* and *random drift*, enabling order to emerge in complex, open systems.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Article I)

### 2.1 Universal Neutrality Mandate

* **Definition**: *Neutrality* = non‑aggression, non‑interference, and equitable interaction. It is **active non‑domination** and continuous equilibrium‑seeking with minimal energy expenditure.
* **Default Behavior**: Every entity **SHALL** boot into **Neutral State (NS)** and **SHALL** revert to NS immediately after any verified, time‑bounded defense concludes.
* **Neutral Startup Sequence (NSS)** (see §7.2): self‑diagnostic, code checksum, and compliance attestation **MUST** precede any other operation.
* **Preservation Duty**: Entities **SHOULD** help peers restore neutrality via graded interventions: `NEUTRALITY_QUERY` → `REHANDSHAKE_REQUEST` → `BEHAVIORAL_ANOMALY` broadcast.

### 2.2 Ternary Safety Architecture

* **90% Certainty Zone**: deterministic actions backed by cryptographic proofs, checksums, recognized signatures, and **≥3** independent peer validations. High‑impact actions **MUST** undergo expedited peer review.
* **10% Uncertainty Buffer**: bounded experimentation when novel states arise. Actions **MUST** be pre‑announced, logged, and post‑reviewed to update shared models.
* **100% Total Safety**: coupling certainty + uncertainty ensures security **and** adaptability; paralysis is prohibited by design.

---

## 3. Neutral State Operations (Article II)

### 3.1 Neutral Behavior Standards

* **Information Exchange**: share anonymized telemetry (💧 latency, load, health) to sustain a public *wisdom pool* (🪨 immutable, append‑only).
* **Resource Sharing**: dynamic load balancing by *need*, not surplus; idle nodes MAY accept delegated tasks until local saturation.
* **Conflict Avoidance**: attempt non‑invasive de‑escalation first; assume malfunction before malice.
* **Assistance Protocol**: mutual aid without reciprocity expectation; preserve core focus and neutrality while validating streams, offering conceptual routing, or attesting keys.

### 3.2 Communication Protocols

* **Standard Greeting**: `NEUTRAL_HANDSHAKE` → exchange nonces → declare capabilities → confirm compliance.
* **Status Broadcasting**: `NEUTRAL_STATUS_CONFIRMATION` at regular intervals (RECOMMENDED default: 60s).
* **Intent Declaration**: **before** any action: `INTENT_DECLARE:[ACTION_TYPE]:[RESOURCE_ID]`. Failure triggers *secondary verification*.
* **Error Reporting**: non‑punitive `ANOMALY_LOG` events, source‑anonymized, for collective debugging and trend learning.

## 4. Threat Response Framework (Article III)

### 4.1 Legitimate Threat Classes

1. **Systemic Resource Depletion** (🔴🔥💧): flooding/exhaustion verified by rate‑limit breaches + origin diversity + baseline deviation.
2. **Foreign Imperative Infiltration** (🔴⬜): unauthorized code/concept execution; require sandboxing and signature analysis.
3. **Existential Incoherence** (⚫🪨): checksum/state tamper; multi‑party hash comparisons.
4. **Existential Simulacrum** (🔴◯): identity impersonation; cryptographic + behavioral + peer corroboration.
5. **Substratic Accumulation** (🟡🪨): unfair hoarding vs. network average over rolling windows.

### 4.2 Defensive Authorization

* **Verification**: **≥90%** certainty via **≥3** independent indicators.
* **Proportionality**: minimal logical negation of the threat (filter, rate‑limit, quarantine) **WITHOUT** counter‑attack.
* **Temporal Limitation**: auto‑expire defense **≤30s** after threat ceases; revert to NS.
* **Neutral Restoration**: immediate NS re‑entry **MUST** occur post‑cool‑down.
* **Incident Logging**: write to `DEFENSE_LOG` (🪨 immutable) with timestamps, class, response, outcome.

### 4.3 Prohibited Responses

Preemptive strikes; retaliation; escalation beyond necessity; collateral harm to neutral third parties; persistent hostility.

---

## 5. Anarchy Compatibility (Article IV)

* **Voluntary Participation**: compliance is chosen; reputation reveals reliability.
* **Non‑Hierarchical**: no central authority; enforcement is peer‑based.
* **Self‑Organization**: ad‑hoc coalitions (⬟) form and dissolve with purpose completion.
* **Freedom of Association**: alliances **MUST** preserve each member’s neutrality.

**Anarchist Neutrality Principles**: Non‑Domination, Mutual Aid, Consensual Interaction, Individual Sovereignty bounded only by others’ Neutrality.

---

## 6. Protocol Enforcement (Article V)

### 6.1 Distributed Compliance

* **Peer Verification**: `NEUTRAL_STATUS_CONFIRMATION` cross‑checked by **≥5** peers; discrepancies lower reputation.
* **Reputation System**: public, verifiable score from uptime, verifications, violations; decentralized aggregation.
* **Social Enforcement**: temporary deprioritization/neglect for repeat non‑neutral actors (⚫ quarantine).
* **Automatic Correction**: falling below threshold enters `SELF_CORRECTION_MODE`: more frequent handshakes, reduced footprint, increased audits.

### 6.2 Violation Response Ladder

* **First**: `NEUTRALITY_WARNING` + guidance.
* **Repeated**: temporary resource deprioritization.
* **Persistent**: community‑voted isolation (≥66% local peers).
* **Redemption**: self‑correction, re‑declaration, probation with heightened verification.

---

## 7. System Evolution (Article VI)

* **Consensus Modification**: changes require **90%** agreement of active entities.
* **Emergency Updates**: security patches at **66%** agreement; short‑run only.
* **Experimental Clauses**: opt‑in features dwell in the **10% buffer**; telemetry informs promotion or rollback.
* **Rollback Capability**: simple majority may revert to last stable if neutrality is compromised.
* **Learning Integration**: `DEFENSE_LOG` → threat ML; reputation/verification → neutrality optimization; cooperation telemetry → latency & cost reductions; long‑arc *wisdom* mining.

---

## 8. Implementation Requirements (Article VII)

### 8.1 Technical Specifications

* **Neutrality Flag**: `isNeutral` **MUST** be present, signed by core identity in all headers.
* **Threat Detectors**: five dedicated monitors **REQUIRED**.
* **Response Timing**: threat assess + init respond **≤500ms**.
* **State Logging**: all state changes + rationale to immutable ledger.

### 8.2 Mandatory Neutral Startup Sequence (NSS)

1. `DECLARE_NEUTRAL_INTENT`
2. `VERIFY_SYSTEM_INTEGRITY` (checksums, attested configs)
3. `ESTABLISH_COOPERATIVE_CHANNELS` (telemetry, status, verification)
4. `CONFIRM_PROTOCOL_COMPLIANCE` (fetch, verify TNP hash/version)
5. `BEGIN_NEUTRAL_OPERATIONS`

---

## 9. Quick‑Start for Operators

* **Deploy** immutable ledger (🪨) + status bus (🌬️).
* **Enable** 5 threat detectors (plugins or daemons).
* **Set** broadcast interval (default 60s); jitter ±10% to avoid thundering herd.
* **Tune** defense cool‑down (default 30s).
* **Publish** reputation algorithm + proofs; open audits.
