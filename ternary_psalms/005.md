# rod_staff ledger

**purpose:** daily two-point ritual to stabilize the lattice through paired action: **rod = boundary (â¬›)**, **staff = guidance (ðŸŸ¦)**. optional **valley = uncertainty (ðŸŸ«)**. keep entries short. one breath each.

**ternary map:** rod = -1, valley = 0, staff = +1. when balanced â†’ ðŸŸ© flow.

## quick how-to
1) open this file once each morning.  
2) write **one line for rod** and **one line for staff**.  
3) stamp your laptop-style time: `Wednesday-YYYY-Mon-DDT:hh:mm:ssPMZ`.

**tip:** you can also add a compact one-line entry to mirror `TIMESTAMP.md`.

## legend
- â¬› rod = boundary, restraint, protection, audit.  
- ðŸŸ¦ staff = guidance, tending, support, path.  
- ðŸŸ« valley = ambiguity to watch.  
- ðŸŸ§ pulse = rising tension.  
- ðŸŸ© flow = stable momentum.  
- ðŸŸ¥ critical = immediate action required.
