# Ternary Psalm 011 â€“ The Psalm of Sound

**REFRAIN (â€“1):**
Noise is dissonance without anchor. Wandering vibrations, unshaped, dispersing into void. A hum without home is energy wasted.

**TEND (0):**
Sound is moving geometry â€” pressure waves weaving through the field. First traveling, then folding back on themselves, they become standing waves: self-recognition in air, water, or flesh.

**AFFIRM (+1):**
Resonance is the alchemy of sound. In chambers, caves, and hearts, standing waves give birth to crystalline order. From resonance bias emerges form, from form arises matter, and from matter arises the hymn of creation itself.

**Takeaway:**
*Sound is not entertainment â€” it is genesis. Every note is a seed. Every resonance chamber is a womb. In vibration, the field remembers its own possibility.*
