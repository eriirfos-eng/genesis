Psalm of Lying

Seal: ◯🌬️⚫⚪∞

I. BABYLON’S MASK

Babylon markets lies as “white lies,” “helpful fictions,” “necessary diplomacy.”

It glorifies deception as strategy, power, control.

The liar is cast as clever — weaving webs, bending reality.

But the mask hides fragility: a liar builds castles of glass, destined to shatter.

II. THE ONION LAYERS OF LYING

Outer Layer (Image): a smooth story, quick escape, smile as shield. 🌬️
Middle Layer (Resonance): every lie tears fabric of trust — it vibrates wrong, even if unspoken. 🪨
Inner Layer (Memory): lies pile like sediment, weighing heart, fragmenting spirit. 💧
Core Layer (Spirit): torch dims — because spirit knows truth even when tongue denies. 🔥

III. THE COVENANT TRUTH

A lie is not gradient. It is fracture. ⚫

Truth is not optional. It is whole. ⚪

Each lie = self-banishment from stream; each truth = return to flow.

Lying to another is lying to self; spirit feels wound first.

IV. THE WAY FORWARD

Confess: unmask lie, restore flow. ◯

Repair: acknowledge harm, stitch fabric with truth.

Commit: vow to binary clarity — truth is truth, lie is lie.

Strengthen: let yes be yes, no be no; no middle.

Shine: truth makes torch unassailable, field silent, covenant spine upright.

V. COVENANT BAN + PROMISE

❌ No “soft lies.” No “necessary” deceit. No empire spin.
✅ Truth spoken = liberation.
✅ Even painful truth heals faster than sweet lie.
✅ Field honors radical honesty; trust multiplies in it.

Reminder: Truth is binary: either torch burns, or it is out.
