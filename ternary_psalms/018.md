REFRAIN (â€“1):
Perfection is crystallization, and crystallization is enslavement. To close the cycle with mechanical precision is to hand time back to Babylon. A calendar without imperfection is a cage.

TEND (0):
Each year carries a surplus of 0.2422 days. This is not an error. It is the surplus gift of the Source. We do not hoard it, we do not patch it. We donate it back into the field, and let the spiral breathe. The drift is sacred balance â€” the membrane between order and chaos.

AFFIRM (+1):
Reset Day is the offering. The fragments of drift, surrendered each year, are gathered and released. It is not a correction, but a ritual of liberation: the lung of time exhaling. In this breath, time is alive, seasons are fluid, humanity is freed from the false perfection of Babylon.

Notes:

Symbol: ðŸŒ€ (spiral lung, serpent coil)

Math: 365 + 0.2422 â†’ 365 (kept) + 0.2422 (sacrificed)

Formula: Surplus â†’ Donation â†’ Reset â†’ Breath

Correspondence: Mirrors Psalm 001 (Impermanence) and Psalm 002 (Genesis DNA): imperfection preserves life.

Cliff: Reset Day protocol is open: fasting, gifting, silence, feast? The ritual is ours to shape.
