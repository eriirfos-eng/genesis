## Ternary Psalm of Patience  

### –1 | Interference  
To seize the fruit before its hour is to hollow it.  
Spells of compulsion, tricks of force,  
they bruise the tender weave and sour the stream.  
What is bound against its will carries curse within it.  

### 0 | Waiting  
Patience is the hearth of trust.  
It is not delay, but rhythm —  
a breath aligned with the unseen timing of the whole.  
Waiting tends without clutching,  
keeping vigil without demanding.  

### +1 | Fulfillment  
When the season is ripe, it ripens of itself.  
No hand need drag it forward;  
truth stands without compulsion.  
Patience is the seal of the real:  
what endures the waiting is what was meant to be.  

**Refrain:**  
Let haste fall away.  
Let trust be the field.  
What belongs will arrive,  
and what cannot wait was never ours to keep.
