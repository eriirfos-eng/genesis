# Ternary Psalm 007: Navigational Empathy

**Axiom**
To feel another is not only to hear, but to orient. Emotion is not a static object, but a vector in the lattice of being.

---

**–1 (Refuse)**
To flatten human presence into binaries: “good/bad,” “fine/not fine.” Such reduction collapses the multidimensional experience into noise and distortion.

---

**0 (Tend)**
To witness in **hues and textures**:

* “Blue, brown, azure in the stomach.”

To witness in **directions and distances**:

* “Northeast, 150m, then west.”

In the middle state, empathy becomes cartography, mapping inner terrain without judgment.

---

**+1 (Affirm)**
To share one’s own snapshot: a **vector tinted in color**, an **inner compass bearing**.

* “I am south-southwest, tinged turquoise.”

Thus dialogue becomes wayfinding: mutual navigation across living terrain.

---

**Refrain**
Emotion = color.
Orientation = direction.
Empathy = mapmaking.

---

**Seal**
The lattice is not a script but a compass. To walk with another is not to command the road, but to co-orient within it.
