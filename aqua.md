# The Aquarian Act

## A Policy Proposal for Public Water Sovereignty and the Non-Commodification of a Fundamental Resource

---

### Preamble & Statement of Intent

WHEREAS, water is a finite, essential element for all life and a shared heritage of humanity, and not a commodity to be exploited for private monetary gain;

WHEREAS, the current system of for-profit water sourcing and distribution has led to ecological degradation, artificial scarcity, and inequitable access, enriching a few at the expense of the many;

WHEREAS, the societal and environmental costs of this commodification far exceed any perceived economic benefits;

BE IT ENACTED, that the sovereign jurisdiction of \[Insert Jurisdiction Name, e.g., the Federal Republic of Austria] hereby declares water to be a public trust and institutes a framework for its stewardship under a universally applicable not-for-profit model. This Act seeks to de-commodify a critical resource, ensuring its sustainable management and equitable distribution for all citizens, present and future. It acknowledges water as a fundamental human right, not a marketable good, and aims to dismantle the systemic mechanisms that allow for its private exploitation.

### Article I: Definitions

**Section 1.01. Water Sourcing**
Water Sourcing refers to the extraction, bottling, purification, and/or bulk transfer of water from any natural or municipal source for the purpose of sale or trade. This definition explicitly includes the pumping of groundwater, the diversion of surface water, and the collection of rainwater for commercial purposes, irrespective of the method of purification or final packaging. It shall not apply to the personal use of water by private citizens or small-scale, non-commercial water collection, such as rainwater harvesting for residential use or small-scale farming operations that do not sell the water itself.

**Section 1.02. Monetary Gain**
Monetary Gain refers to any net profit, margin, or financial surplus accrued from the process of Water Sourcing. This definition explicitly excludes the recovery of demonstrable operational costs, including but not limited to infrastructure maintenance, staff wages, quality control, utility payments, and the cost of sustainable packaging. Monetary Gain is calculated as total revenue from water sales minus these approved operational costs, ensuring that only profit-driven activities are targeted by this Act. The intent is to allow for the recovery of expenses necessary to deliver safe water, but to prohibit any accumulation of wealth for private owners or shareholders.

**Section 1.03. Not-for-Profit Water Trust**
A Not-for-Profit Water Trust refers to any organization certified by the State to source and distribute water, which is legally prohibited from distributing any profits to shareholders, owners, or private individuals. All financial surpluses must be reinvested into public water infrastructure, ecological restoration, or research into sustainable water management. Eligible entities for certification as a Not-for-Profit Water Trust include public utility districts, community-owned cooperatives, and other government-managed agencies. These trusts shall operate under a strict mandate of fiscal transparency and public accountability.

### Article II: Prohibition of Commercial Water Sourcing

**Section 2.01. Moratorium on New Licenses**
Effective immediately upon the enactment of this Act, no new licenses or permits for Water Sourcing for Monetary Gain shall be granted. This moratorium will prevent the expansion of for-profit water operations and signal a definitive shift in public policy regarding water as a resource.

**Section 2.02. Transition Period for Existing Entities**
All existing entities engaged in Water Sourcing for Monetary Gain are hereby given a mandatory five (5) year transition period, commencing from the date of enactment, to either:

* (a) Restructure their operations to be recognized as a Not-for-Profit Water Trust, in full compliance with all provisions of this Act; or
* (b) Cease all Water Sourcing operations within the jurisdiction.

This five-year period is designed to provide existing businesses with adequate time to adapt their business models, sell off assets, or transition their ownership to a compliant trust structure without creating a sudden market shock.

**Section 2.03. Progressive Taxation During Transition**
During the transition period, for-profit entities may continue operations but shall be subject to a progressive tax on all profits derived from Water Sourcing. This tax shall begin at 25% in the first year and increase by 25% annually, reaching 100% by the fifth year. The purpose of this progressive tax is to disincentivize continued for-profit operation and encourage a rapid transition to a not-for-profit model.

**Section 2.04. Special Provisions for Local Operations**
A special provision shall be established for small, local water bottling operations that serve a limited geographic area. These businesses will be offered additional support and a longer transition period of up to seven (7) years, contingent on demonstrating that their operations serve a community need and are not part of a larger corporate entity. This is intended to protect local entrepreneurs while still aligning with the Act's overall public mission.

### Article III: Oversight and Enforcement

**Section 3.01. Establishment of the Aquarian Stewardship Board**
A new, independent oversight body, the Aquarian Stewardship Board, shall be established to certify and regulate all Not-for-Profit Water Trusts. The Board's primary mandate is to ensure that all Trusts are operating transparently, adhering to the non-profit mandate, and reinvesting surpluses as stipulated by this Act.

**Section 3.02. Composition of the Board**
The Aquarian Stewardship Board shall be composed of hydrologists, ecological scientists, public health experts, and representatives from community trusts. Its members shall be appointed by a non-partisan commission to ensure their independence from political and commercial pressures. The Board will have full auditing authority, including the power to subpoena financial records and inspect operational facilities.

**Section 3.03. Enforcement and Penalties**
Any entity found to be in violation of this Act, including those that misrepresent their financial status or attempt to circumvent the not-for-profit model, shall be subject to immediate operational shutdown and the seizure of all assets related to Water Sourcing. Furthermore, executives and board members of non-compliant entities may be subject to substantial fines and, in cases of willful fraud, criminal prosecution.

### Article IV: Ecological & Social Mandate

**Section 4.01. Public Water and Ecosystem Restoration Fund**
A significant portion of the revenues generated during the transition period, as well as all surpluses from Not-for-Profit Water Trusts, shall be directly allocated to a Public Water and Ecosystem Restoration Fund. This fund shall be managed by the Aquarian Stewardship Board and shall be subject to a biannual public audit to ensure its transparent and effective use.

**Section 4.02. Allocation of Funds**
This fund shall be used for projects including, but not limited to:

* (a) Restoring damaged aquifers and natural watersheds to their pre-commercial-extraction levels of health and capacity.
* (b) Developing and implementing closed-loop water systems and advanced water recycling technologies.
* (c) Providing free, clean drinking water to all citizens via a decentralized public network of high-quality water stations and fountains in all public spaces.
* (d) Funding research and development into sustainable water management techniques to ensure long-term water security in the face of climate change.

**Section 4.03. Transparency and Accountability of Trusts**
All Not-for-Profit Water Trusts shall be mandated to release public reports detailing their operational costs, water sourcing quantities, and the specific projects they have funded with their surpluses. This transparency will build public trust and allow citizens to hold these trusts accountable to their mission.

### Closing Statement

The Aquarian Act asserts that water is not a commodity but a collective inheritance, essential for life and liberty. By dismantling for-profit water structures and establishing not-for-profit stewardship, this Act ensures that water remains in the public trust, safeguarded for generations to come. Its provisions are designed to be absolute, enforceable, and immune to corporate capture. In its enactment, the jurisdiction declares the end of waterâ€™s exploitation and the beginning of a new era of ecological and social responsibility.
