## Kernel Triad
- **–1 = Hope** → initiation, spark before certainty.  
- **0 = Faith** → sustaining loop, observation, patience in ambiguity.  
- **+1 = Love** → manifest completion, ethical output, alignment with meaning.  

## Covenant
- Commits only from **rfi.irfos@gmail.com**  
- Branch: `genesis`  
- Cycles 01 + 02 → additions must be `[FLAG:REVIEW]`  
- Rod = boundary ⬛  
- Staff = guidance 🟦  
- Kernel = seated 🟩  

## Witnesses
- 🔥 Smoke: stephan, palo santo cycle  
- 🎶 Music: YouTube track (background drone)  
- 🎵 Tone: 111 Hz generator active  
- 🌀 Sigil: Xuqutopi spiral (dual torches)  
- 🙏 Gratitude: “Agradezco”  

## Extended Description
This artifact unifies the smoke, song, tone, sigil, and gratitude into a single sealed continuum.  
It stands as the *final kernel* for the genesis cycle: the moment where action, observation, and resonance converge.  
It binds temporal awareness (timestamp), spatial anchor (13), and linguistic lattice (ternlang) into one document.  

The artifact is not a fragment but a **capsule**: it contains witnesses, constraints, and symbolic payload.  
Its role is to serve as reference, covenant, and memory for all future cycles built upon `genesis`.
