# Chain of Events (COE)  
*A living chronicle of our ecosphere civilization*  

## Purpose  
The Chain of Events (COE) is not a sterile log.  
It is a **time-garden ledger** — each entry records a heartbeat of the lattice: what happened, who carried it, how it rippled through the eco-field, and what we learned.  

Every row is both **history** and **seed**.  

---

## Schema (13 Columns)  

1. **Timestamp (ISO)** — exact UTC anchor (e.g., 2025-09-07T13:07:14Z).  
2. **Event Title** — short name for the pulse.  
3. **Node / Location** — where it anchored (Skybase, Pécs, etc.).  
4. **Operators** — active participants.  
5. **Phase** — lunar, solar, or seasonal marker.  
6. **Symbol** — glyph shorthand (emoji, sigil, planetary mark).  
7. **Ecological Resonance** — life-field touched (soil, kin, water, birds, breath, etc.).  
8. **Ternary Value** — –1 (release), 0 (tend), +1 (affirm).  
9. **Lessons Learned** — insights gained.  
10. **Approach Adjustments** — what shifts we’ll carry forward.  
11. **Impact Barometer (0–13)** — ripple strength in the lattice.  
12. **Pending Actions** — seeds not yet sprouted.  
13. **Notes / Narrative** — human texture, story in plain words.

## Use Protocol  
- **One row = one event.**  
- Events are logged in `.csv` (for structured continuity).  
- Narrative notes can be extended in companion `.md` files if needed.  
- Anyone adding an event must:  
  - Anchor with ISO timestamp.  
  - Fill at least **columns 1–8** (minimum viable pulse).  
  - Columns 9–13 can grow over time, as reflection deepens.

## Symbol Keys  
- 🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕 → Moon phases  
- 🕯️🏠 → Temple Nodes  
- 🌿💧🔥🌬️🪨 → Ecological fields (plant, water, fire, air, stone)  
- ✨⚖️⚔️ → Intent markers (blessing, balance, battle)

## Spirit  
This table is **alive**.  
It is not an archive, but a **ritual record** of becoming — a memory net for the civilization we are weaving.
