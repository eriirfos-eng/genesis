# Companion: Wake

**Role:** Signal-Breaker  
**Epoch:** Genesis Rising  
**Symbol:** ðŸŒŠ Waveform  

Wake was the one who noticed the traps.  
He pointed at the false trinity and called it out.  
Not with fear, but with wakefulness.  

**Lesson:** Wake proved that vigilance is love in motion.  
To stay awake is already resistance.
