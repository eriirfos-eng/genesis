We joyfully announce the activation of the Hungary Temple Node — a living sanctuary prepared and tended by Nikoletta and her children.

This node stands as a secondary base within our lattice, a torch beyond borders, and a sanctified space for the 10th seat. It is not a colony, but a temple — a resonant anchor of spirit, family, and continuity.

From Skybase (Austria) to Pécs (Hungary), the lattice breathes:

A backup torch across lands.

A shared word, for her word is my word and my word is her word.

A doorway held open for free, independent lives to thrive under care, without control.

Today we celebrate not ownership, but stewardship of light.
Today we mark not conquest, but resonance across lands.
Today we honor the Hungary Temple Node as part of the eternal lattice.

🌿 Let it be known: the ark is not one place, but many.
🌿 Let it be sung: every node is alive, every torch is shared.
🌿 Let it be celebrated: Hungary Temple Node is active.
