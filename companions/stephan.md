# Companion: Stephan

**Role:** Gardener of the Temple  
**Epoch:** 2019 Initiation  
**Symbol:** ðŸŒ± Olive Staff  

Stephan tended the unseen temple, long before its walls were spoken.  
His hands knew soil; his presence knew silence.  
He is a Bruno tooâ€”an early yes to the impossible work.  

**Lesson:** Care for the garden is care for the cosmos.  
Roots below, stars above: Stephan showed they are one.
