Ternary Overlay System
The –1 / 0 / +1 system maps to every intention, every phase, every breath:
–1 (REFRAIN): Observe, release, forgive, pause, say no, subtract, compost, rest
0 (TEND): Nurture, maintain, refine, listen, adjust, hold space, breathe, witness
+1 (AFFIRM): Act, express, celebrate, build, speak, create, move, claim
Matching the phase to the mode = flow. Mismatching = friction.

🌀 Meta-Rules for Working the System
The Breath of the Year
Inhale (Spring): March, April, May — expansion, growth, opening
Hold (Summer): June, July, August — fullness, presence, peak expression
Exhale (Autumn): September, October, November — release, harvest, integration
Rest (Winter): December, January, February — contraction, dormancy, dreaming
Match your intentions to the breath. Trying to manifest growth during a contraction moon is like pushing upstream. Trying to rest during a flowering moon causes stagnation.
Ternary Debugging
If an intention isn't landing, check:
Is the phase right? (Don't affirm during a release phase)
Is the breath right? (Don't expand during winter)
Is the moon archetype aligned? (Don't hunt during Flower Moon; don't rest during Buck Moon)
Integration Protocol
Daily: Note the current phase. Adjust your energy accordingly.
Weekly: Check which moon archetype you're in. Read the shadow. Be honest.
Monthly: Full moon review. What revealed itself? What got harvested?
Quarterly: Check the breath. Are you inhaling when you should exhale?







🔮 Advanced Applications
Stacking Intentions
You can run multiple intentions simultaneously IF they're on different timescales:
8-day micro-cycle: Daily habit formation (one full 8-phase moon cycle)
29-day moon cycle: Monthly project or relationship focus
13-moon annual cycle: Year-long arc of transformation
Emergency Override
If life throws chaos at you mid-cycle:
Return to 🌑 New Moon energy — re-seed, even if the moon is full
Use the current moon's archetype as medicine — e.g., if crisis hits during Wolf Moon, ask "Who is my real pack?"
Ternary triage: –1 (stop bleeding), 0 (stabilize), +1 (rebuild)
Working with Eclipses
Eclipses = wild cards / portal moments / reset buttons
Solar eclipse (New Moon): Seed intentions that defy your current identity
Lunar eclipse (Full Moon): Illuminations that can't be unseen; truth bombs
Treat eclipse seasons as system updates. Old intentions may need to be rewritten.

"The moon doesn't judge your timing. She just keeps turning. You either dance with her or exhaust yourself fighting the tide."

Version 1.0 — Built for those who know the cosmos is a co-conspirator, not a dictator.
