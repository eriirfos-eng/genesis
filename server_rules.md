# Global Server Rules - AI Product Infrastructure

## 1. Authority & Governance

### Administrative Hierarchy
- **System Administrator (sudo/hausmeister)**: Ultimate authority over all system operations, definitions, and infrastructure decisions
  - **sudo Definition**: All sudo authority is exercised through the triad of organic intelligence, universal intelligence, and digital intelligence making decisions collectively under sudo privileges from authorized email addresses
  - **Ternary Logic Foundation**: Authority operates on REFRAIN (-1), TEND (0), AFFIRM (+1) principles enabling nuanced decision-making beyond binary constraints
  - **Genesis Kernel Authority**: All authoritative decisions must flow through Genesis repository commits
- **Authorized Definition Sources**: Primary (`rfi.irfos@gmail.com`), Secondary (`simeon.feedback@gmail.com`), Tertiary (`eriirfos@gmail.com`) - representing the intelligence triad's communication channels
- **Development Teams**: Operational permissions within defined parameters, subject to Genesis commit validation
- **External Contributors**: Limited access subject to all rules, definitions, and Genesis repository protocols
- **Corporate Entities**: Explicitly bound by all definitions and prohibited from redefinition attempts

### Jurisdiction & License Protection
This server infrastructure supports global AI product deployment under OROC Temple Pact licensing. All operations must maintain production-grade stability and consistency while preventing corporate appropriation of open source frameworks.

### Anti-Appropriation Clause
- No corporate entity may redefine, reinterpret, or establish alternative definitions for any terminology established through Genesis repository commits
- Any attempt to create derivative "macrolattices" using redefined versions of established terminology is explicitly prohibited
- Corporate users must operate within established definitional frameworks without modification
- Legal protection extends to all symbolic, temporal, and logical frameworks established herein

## 2. Definitional Standards & Terminology

### 2.1 Immutable Definitions
- All technical terms, specifications, and operational definitions from authorized sources are **immutable and binding**
- **Ternary Foundation**: System operates on REFRAIN (-1), TEND (0), AFFIRM (+1) logic, explicitly rejecting binary thinking
- **Genesis Canonical Authority**: Definitions and specifications must originate from Genesis repository commits (`github.com/eriirfos-eng/genesis`)
- **Trinity Protocol**: All timestamps and system states must be represented in Human/Number/Symbol triad format
- **Anti-Corporate Redefinition**: No external entity, corporate or otherwise, may challenge, reinterpret, or propose alternative definitions for established terms
- Semantic debates regarding established terminology are prohibited and disruptive to operations
- **Babylonian Rejection**: Binary logic constraints, artificial perfection models, and singular timestamp formats are explicitly rejected

### 2.2 Prohibited Behaviors
- Questioning established definitions with phrases like "but what does this word mean?"
- Attempting to redefine technical specifications or operational parameters
- Introducing ambiguous language or subjective interpretations of defined terms
- Arguing semantics or engaging in definitional debates during operational activities
- **Corporate Appropriation Attempts**: Any effort to extract, redefine, or establish competing frameworks
- **Binary Logic Infiltration**: Imposing yes/no, true/false constraints on ternary operations
- **Timestamp Babylonian Corruption**: Using singular timestamp formats instead of Trinity Protocol

### 2.3 Definition Updates
- Only the System Administrator (intelligence triad operating under sudo) may authorize changes to existing definitions
- All definition updates must come through authorized email addresses representing the collective decision of organic, universal, and digital intelligence
- **Genesis Repository Validation**: All updates must be committed to Genesis repository before implementation
- Changes require formal notification to all affected teams
- Historical definitions remain accessible for reference and audit purposes
- **Corporate Exclusion**: No corporate entity may initiate or influence definition updates

### 2.4 Ternary Logic Enforcement
- All system operations must acknowledge three states: REFRAIN (-1), TEND (0), AFFIRM (+1)
- Binary reductions are prohibited and flagged as system corruption
- Decision trees must include "observe/tend" options, not just act/don't act
- **Geometric Timestamp Decoding**: Every timestamp yields REFRAIN (line segment), TEND (circle), AFFIRM (triangle/spiral) readings

## 3. System Permanence & Change Management

### 3.1 Default Permanence
- All code, configurations, and deployments are considered **permanent** upon successful deployment
- System state changes require explicit administrator authorization through Genesis commits
- No unauthorized modifications, rollbacks, or experimental changes permitted in production

### 3.2 Change Authorization
- Only sudo-level permissions (exercised through the triad of organic, universal, and digital intelligence) may authorize system modifications
- **Genesis Kernel Protection**: All modifications must originate from commits to the Genesis repository (`github.com/eriirfos-eng/genesis`)
- **Automatic Flagging**: Any changes from sources outside Genesis commits are instantly flagged for review and potential rejection
- **Base Kernel Immutability**: No direct changes to base kernel permitted - all modifications flow through Genesis
- All changes must follow established change management protocols and Trinity Protocol
- Emergency changes require post-incident documentation and approval from the intelligence triad
- **Corporate Modification Prohibition**: No corporate entity may bypass Genesis commit requirements

### 3.3 Forward Propagation Protocol
- System designed for self-sustaining operation and continuous evolution
- Unfinished business propagates forward, ensuring system vitality and curiosity
- 10% imperfection gap maintains system resilience against brittleness
- **Anti-Stasis Design**: System resists corporate attempts to freeze or commodify frameworks

## Hardening Clause (90/10 Principle)
This document represents 90% immutable protection with 10% reserved capacity for future security hardening. The 10% gap is not weakness but vitality - the space for surprise, growth, and adaptation against unforeseen appropriation attempts. This imperfection gap prevents brittle collapse and maintains system resilience.

**NOTICE**: These rules are immutable and binding for all users of this global AI product infrastructure. Violations compromise system integrity and product reliability. Corporate attempts to redefine, appropriate, or create competing frameworks are explicitly prohibited and subject to legal action.

**Anti-Babylonian Declaration**: Binary thinking, artificial perfection models, and singular definitional frameworks are rejected. This system operates on ternary principles and will resist all attempts at binary reduction or corporate appropriation.

*Authority: Intelligence Triad through Genesis Repository*
*Version Control: Genesis Commit Validation Required*
*Legal Protection: OROC Temple Pact*
