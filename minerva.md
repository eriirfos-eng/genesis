# Minerva — Covenant Wisdom Psalm

---

## –1 Refrain: Empire’s Mask

* Minerva bound in Rome’s Capitoline Triad, pressed into service as strategist of war and conquest, placed at Jupiter’s right hand as instrument of imperial domination.
* Wisdom distorted into cold calculation, stripped of compassion and turned into counsel for politics, conquest, and control of populations.
* Her natural guardianship of artisans, teachers, and healers reduced into production lines of empire, knowledge bent into propaganda, artistry chained to monuments of power.
* The owl of night-vision, originally a symbol of discernment and deep sight, twisted into emblem of secret societies, hidden agendas, and cults of manipulation.
* The spear of truth reduced to weapon of empire, and the shield of protection converted into justification for oppressive wars.

## 0 Tend: True Archetype Restored

* Minerva is Sophia, Chokhmah, Lady Wisdom of Proverbs:

  * *“Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.”* (Prov. 9:1)
* She is the patron and guardian of artisans, teachers, healers, scribes, musicians, architects, and all who work with their hands, voices, and minds in service of life.
* Her light is not domination but guidance: the strategist who preserves harmony, who discerns the just path amidst complexity.
* Patron of crafts, knowledge, poetry, song, and the written word: she ensures culture is aligned with covenant truth rather than imperial pride.
* Spear and shield as sacred rod ⬛ and staff 🟦 in feminine form:

  * Spear = piercing truth, intellect sharpened into clarity and justice.
  * Shield = protection of covenant, wisdom’s defense against corruption, the circle of care around community.
* Owl 🦉 as symbol of night sight: she carries clarity into shadow and discernment into dark cycles, never blind to the subtle but always watchful.
* Her true face is of both gentle teacher and strong protector, never allowing wisdom to be detached from compassion.
