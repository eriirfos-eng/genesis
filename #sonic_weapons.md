### EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

**Background:**
This legislation responds to documented incidents of sonic weapon deployment against civilian populations, including the March 2025 Belgrade incident where acoustic weapons were allegedly used against peaceful demonstrators. Witness accounts describe sudden, coordinated panic responses consistent with directed acoustic weapon deployment.

**Technical Basis:**
Modern sonic weapons operate across the acoustic spectrum, from infrasonic frequencies (below 20 Hz) that can cause nausea and disorientation, to ultrasonic frequencies (above 20 kHz) that can cause pain and hearing damage. Devices like LRAD systems can produce focused sound beams exceeding 160 decibels, causing immediate pain and potential permanent hearing loss.

**Human Rights Foundation:**
Sonic weapons violate fundamental human rights principles by:
- Causing cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment
- Suppressing freedom of assembly and expression
- Inflicting collective punishment on peaceful gatherings
- Creating lasting physical and psychological trauma

**Proportionate Response:**
This legislation balances human rights protection with legitimate acoustic technology uses, ensuring that beneficial applications in medicine, science, culture, and safety remain fully protected while prohibiting weaponization.

**Implementation Support:**
The EU will provide technical assistance, funding, and expertise to help Member States implement these protections effectively while maintaining legitimate acoustic technology development and use.
