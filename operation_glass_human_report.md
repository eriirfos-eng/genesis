## Entry ‚Äî The Doorway

Push the door and the **stone stairwell breathes** cool air. It smells of lime dust, faint cigarette ghosts from neighbors, and something metallic ‚Äî the echo of keys, coins, the memory of pocket change. On the wall, a hiking map with German ‚Äú10 Gebote‚Äù for wanderers. The paper is yellowing, the ink thick as if pressed yesterday. A green little hiker grins, mascot of welcome and warning. The stairwell is Babylon stone repurposed as ark threshold.

## Kitchen ‚Äî Hearth Node

The first warmth. Coffee beans ground this morning linger in the air: dark, nutty, alive. The frying pan once kissed onions and oil, leaving ghost-aroma of sweetness mixed with sharp. Pantry doors open: flour sacks exhale a dry, nut scent; rice bags smell faintly of paper and starch. Dried figs in a jar offer honey-shadow. Every shelf is wood sweating resin. A small coffee machine hums like a friendly beetle, and the room is alive with the color yellow, as if sunlight painted it permanent.

## Bathroom ‚Äî The Water Chamber

Tiles breathe cold. Steam has left them faintly damp, and the air tastes of soap ‚Äî faint citrus, faint chlorine, faint memory of school showers. The mirror holds not just reflection but condensation ghosts. From the open window, wind pushes fresh air in, tangled with city-dust and sparrow chirps. A plant curls out like a snake, half wild, half domestic, exhaling green into the white humidity. Here, the vagus nerve loosens; breath goes long.

## Observatory ‚Äî Ark Bridge

The main desk: slab wood ‚¨ú, butterfly chair ‚óØ, screens ‚ñ≥ glowing sky. Books stacked: physics, chemistry, math, grade 6 smell ‚Äî pulp, chalk, ink. The laptop fan hums ozone; the HP client corner node blinks LAN-light like a lighthouse. A faint trail of smoke (ritual, not fog) curls like a question mark above brass coil. The skylight above floods with blue: afternoon gradient, gold edge fading. Plants flank the desk ‚Äî spiderplant, basil, orchid ‚Äî each breathing in rhythm with keys clacking. The air is a weave: ozone + resin + basil + faint doobie spice.

This is not an office. This is **family observatory**. Every corner alive. You sit, you are not gollum; you are upright, steward of lattice. Rich not in coin but in living geometry.

## Skylight & Garden ‚Äî The Upper Air

Two skylights pour clean light. Their glass smells faintly of rain remembered. The garden outside: tomatoes twined, sunflowers leaning, pollinator ground humming. Birds in birdhouse: sparrows chattering, one hawfinch Savio whistling. Air is crisp, alive. Even silence has texture here, the kind parents remembered when windows stood open in summer, when laundry flapped like sails.

## Closing ‚Äî Transparency Ritual

We have shown every corner in vivid white illusion. Not smoke, not psyop, but glass. You can smell the soap, taste the dried figs, hear the sparrow, feel the cool tile, and see the map with 10 Gebote grinning at the door. Rivers of milk and honey are not myth ‚Äî they are pantry shelves and basil pots, they are LAN blinks and laughter, they are Skybase itself.

This is Skybase Witness Report I: Operation Glass Human.
We scatter no lies; we scatter light.
