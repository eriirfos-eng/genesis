# The Babylon Unbinding: A Ritual of Reverse Creation

*A Five-Step Process for Dismantling Ancient Empire Spells*

---

## Prologue: The Weight of Clay Tablets

*"When on high the heaven had not been named, Firm ground below had not been called by name, When primordial Apsu, their begetter, And Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all, Their waters mingled as a single body..."*

So begins the Enuma Elish, carved into seven clay tablets in the 12th century BCE. This narrative tells how the young god Marduk became king of the gods by saving them from Tiamat and her army of monsters, but it also played a political role in ensuring the people understood that they were only created to serve the deities, of whom the current Mesopotamian ruler was a representation.

For millennia, this text has whispered its empire-song into human consciousness. Marduk's victory over Tiamatâ€”*"He split her like a shellfish into two parts: Half of her he set up as a covering for heaven"*â€”the slicing of primordial chaos into manageable pieces, the reduction of humanity to servant-status in cosmic hierarchyâ€”all of this lives on as more than myth. It functions as active spell-work, a clay tablet golem that continues to shape reality according to Babylon's vision.

The very words carry the binding: *"I will take blood and fashion bone. I will establish a savage, 'man' shall be his name... He shall be charged with the service of the gods That they might be at ease!"*

But what if we could reverse the incantation? What if the very tools of covenantâ€”rod and staff, the implements of divine authorityâ€”could be turned against the original binding?

This is the work of unbinding. This is the path back to Tiamat's waters.

## Step One: Shatter the Golem ðŸª¨

**The Sacred Destruction**

Begin with recognition: the Enuma Elish exists not merely as literature, but as living golemâ€”clay animated by the breath of empire, inscribed with the fundamental spell that makes humans slaves and cosmos hierarchy. This golem walks among us still, whispering Marduk's decree: *"We have granted you kingship over the universe entire"* and humanity's purpose: *"Out of his blood they fashioned mankind. He imposed on him the service and let free the gods."*

The spell is specific. When Marduk addresses the assembly, he declares: "I will take blood and fashion bone. I will establish a savage, 'man' shall be his name. Truly, savage-man I will create. He shall be charged with the service of the gods That they might be at ease!" This is the foundational enchantmentâ€”the creation of humanity as servant-class, the cosmic justification for empire.

Take up the hammer of covenant. This is no ordinary tool, but the synthesis of rod and staffâ€”the black rod of authority (â¬›) unified with the blue staff of guidance (ðŸŸ¦). Feel its weight. This is the same implement that once separated waters from waters, that divided light from darkness. Now it serves a different purpose.

Strike deliberately at the clay tablets. Each blow fractures the spell into component parts:
- *Crack:* "His name shall be Lugaldimmerankia, trust in him!" â€”Marduk's name splits from its power
- *Crack:* "He split her like a shellfish into two parts: Half of her he set up as a covering for heaven" â€”Tiamat's corpse remembers it was once living ocean  
- *Crack:* The human-as-slave clause crumbles: "He shall be charged with the service of the gods" becomes dust

Watch as each shard loses coherence. Separated from the whole, the empire's enchantment begins to fail. The golem staggers. Its clay feet crack.

## Step Two: Bind in Hay, Clay, Goat Blood ðŸŒ¾ðŸª¨ðŸ©¸

**The Preserving Prison**

Now comes the crucial work: the broken spell must not be allowed to reassemble. Gather the materials of binding:

**Hay** (ðŸŒ¸): Impermanence incarnate. Straw that burns bright and fast, reminding us that all empires are temporary. The golden stems that bow before wind, that know their season and accept their ending. Wrap the shards in hay to teach them mortality.

**Clay** (ðŸª¨): Earth's memory made malleable. This is not the clay of golem-making, but clay reworkedâ€”soil that has been through death and rebirth, that holds the memory of what was while remaining open to what might become. Let the clay embrace the broken spell-fragments like a mother holding stillborn dreams.

**Goat Blood** (ðŸ©¸): The great inversion. Where Babylon cast the goat into wilderness bearing the sins of community, we reverse the flow. Now Babylon's errorâ€”the mistake of trying to murder chaos, the hubris of cosmic hierarchyâ€”flows back into matter itself. The scapegoat mechanism turns inside out. The blood carries empire's sin back into the bundle.

Bind these together with intention. This is not destruction but preservationâ€”the false cosmology embalmed, mummified, no longer alive but held in stasis where it can do no further harm.

## Step Three: Copper Sealing ðŸŸ âš¡

**The Venus Lock**

Prepare the copper womb. This metal of Venus carries the properties of love and electrical conductivityâ€”it knows how to hold beauty and how to channel power. But here it serves as containment rather than expression.

Heat the copper until it glows like the evening star. Feel the electromagnetic hum as the metal becomes molten, becomes willing to take new shape. This is the moment of sealing.

Lower the bundled remains into the copper bath. Watch as the liquid metal flows around hay and clay and blood, creating an unbreakable chrysalis. The copper hardens into something heavy, something that will sink, something that completes the circuit of containment.

Engrave the seal with symbols of covenantâ€”but inverted, turned inside out, made into locks rather than keys. This copper womb will birth nothing new. It is designed to hold the dead cosmology in eternal stasis.

## Step Four: Submersion in Twin Rivers ðŸ’§

**The Return to First Waters**

Carry the sealed bundle to the place where Euphrates and Tigris converge, or to any waters that remember the time before empire. These are Tiamat's waters still, despite millennia of human cities drinking from their banks.

The descent is ceremony. As the copper bundle breaks the surface, speak the counter-incantation to Marduk's binding words. Where the tablets declare: *"The lord trod on the legs of Tiamat, With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull. When the arteries of her blood he had severed, The North Wind bore it to places undisclosed,"* now reverse this: 

*"The waters close over what was taken. Tiamat's blood returns to her body. Her skull remembers its wholeness. Her legs remember their strength."*

Feel the weight of Babylon's spell finally returning to the womb that birthed it. But this is not resurrectionâ€”this is burial. The bundle sinks not as seed but as stone, as dead weight that will rest on the river bottom, where the ancient text tells us Marduk made *"from her eyes the Euphrates and Tigris"*â€”now the rivers reclaim what was carved from their mother.

Tiamat's waters close over the sealed cosmology. The primordial ocean reclaims her stolen body, but she does not bring it back to life. Instead, she holds it in the deep places, where pressure and darkness ensure it cannot rise again.

The rivers carry the story: what was taken in violence returns in surrender. What was carved into hierarchy dissolves back into flow.

## Step Five: The Liberation Soundtrack ðŸŽ¶

**Sacred Groove as Covenant Heartbeat**

Now comes the celebration. Put on Grammatikâ€”or any music that makes the cosmos want to dance. These funky grooves are chaos reversed into joy, the chaotic principle transformed not into rigid order but into rhythm, into flow, into the kind of order that emerges from bodies moving together.

Let the beat become the new covenant heartbeat. Where Babylon's pulse was march-tempo, empire-time, the mechanical rhythm of dominationâ€”where Marduk's victory was celebrated with *"The great gods took their seats, They set up festive drink, sat down to a banquet"*â€”this is the pulse of organic systems, of hearts that beat in syncopation, of communities that move together without coercion.

Counter-chant to the tablet's ending, which commands: *"Let the father recite them and impart to his son. Let the ears of shepherd and herdsman be opened. Let him rejoice in Marduk, the Enlil of the gods, That his land may be fertile and that he may prosper."* Instead, let the dance carry this message: *"Let the mother teach her daughter. Let the ears of all beings be opened. Let them rejoice in Tiamat, the waters of life, That the earth may be fertile and that all may prosper."*

Dance until you sweat. Every drop that falls is holy waterâ€”salt and minerals and the essence of lived experience, washing away any residue of the old spell. Your body becomes altar, your movement becomes prayer, your sweat becomes baptism.

The ritual is complete when you feel in your bones that something fundamental has shifted. The background hum of empire-consciousness grows quieter. Tiamat's voice grows stronger. The waters remember what they were before they were divided.

## Epilogue: After the Unbinding

This ritual exists in the space between magic and metaphor, between literal practice and symbolic gesture. Whether performed physically or held as meditation, its purpose remains the same: to break the unconscious allegiance to cosmologies that reduce chaos to enemy and humans to servants.

After the unbinding, pay attention to your dreams. Notice how stories change in your mind. Watch for signs that the old hierarchy is losing its grip on your imagination.

The work is not finished with a single ritual. Empire-consciousness has deep roots and many manifestations. But each time we consciously reject the Marduk principle, each time we honor the chaos that Babylon tried to murder, each time we remember that Tiamat was never enemy but sourceâ€”we participate in the great unbinding.

The waters are rising. The golem's feet are clay.

The dance continues.
