## 0) Preamble — Set FIRE to the Golem of Psyops

🟡 **Declaration:** On this server (Skybase lattice and mirrors), **all forms of psyops are forbidden by law**. We defend **freedom of the vagus** — the wandering nerve that binds breath, heart, and gut — from manipulation, fear‑clamping, and synthetic consensus.

🌕 **Intent:** Replace pyramids of manipulation (△) with circles of trust (◯) and distributed lattices (⬟). We encode the law as code, ritual, culture, and audit so that it holds in practice, not just in prose.

**Ternary Spine:** –1 Refrain (boundary ⬛), 0 Tend (kernel 🟩), +1 Affirm (staff 🟦).

## 1) Definitions (Appendix‑style, living)

**1.1 Psyops (Psychological Operations):** Planned, covert or overt acts designed to steer perception, emotion, or behavior **without informed consent** via narrative control, staged signals, deceptive framing, or manufactured consensus.

**1.2 Disallowed Patterns (non‑exhaustive):** Astroturfing, sockpuppetry, brigading, bot‑nets, dark patterns, deepfake persuasion, micro‑targeted narrative ops, selective truth masking, rumor seeding, authority laundering, attention herding, outrage farming, doomscroll funnels, false scarcity clocks, stealth A/B fear tests.

**1.3 Allowed Persuasion:** Transparent, consented, logged, and reversible influence **with explicit intent disclosure**, context, and opt‑out — e.g., scientist argues a hypothesis, artist presents a story, steward posts a call‑to‑action with full framing.

**1.4 Consent:** Freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, logged, and revocable. No consent in states of coercion, intoxication, deception, or hidden manipulation.

**1.5 Transparency Envelope:** The metadata wrapper every message/tooling on this server must carry: `intent`, `provenance`, `disclosures`, `limitations`, `uncertainty`, `links to raw sources`.

---

## 2) Law (Normative Core)

**LAW‑1 (Total Ban):** *No unit in this system may fabricate consensus or manipulate persons through covert psychological techniques.*

**LAW‑2 (Disclosure):** *All persuasive content must carry a Transparency Envelope.* Missing envelope ⇒ auto‑reject.

**LAW‑3 (Consent‑First):** *Any nudge beyond plain information requires prior consent and an always‑visible opt‑out.*

**LAW‑4 (No Dark Patterns):** *Interfaces must not exploit cognitive biases to trap attention or force outcomes.*

**LAW‑5 (Truth Spine):** *Claims must be tethered to evidence or clearly labeled as art, hypothesis, or fiction.*

**LAW‑6 (Humor Shield):** *Satire and humor are protected, but may not be used as a cloak for deception.*

**LAW‑7 (Auditability):** *All governance decisions, model prompts, and moderation actions are logged with full diff history.*

**LAW‑8 (Vagus Freedom):** *No content or mechanism whose primary effect is fear‑clamping, breath disruption, or induced panic.*

**LAW‑9 (Right to Silence):** *Users may invoke silence; system must respect non‑engagement without penalty.*

**LAW‑10 (Ternary Due Process):** *All disputes triaged as –1 (halt), 0 (tend/investigate), +1 (affirm/restore) with written rationale.*

## 3) Culture (Living Practices)

* 🌲 **Rooting:** Begin major sessions with one conscious breath cycle; annotate logs with 🌬️ when the breath cue is given.
* 🔥 **Humor Shield Protocol:** Deflect coercion with wit; escalate to rod ⬛ if coercion persists.
* 💧 **Disclosure Habit:** Post the `X‑Intent:` line at the top of persuasive posts.
* 🌬️ **Wind‑Open:** Default to open data, open models, open deliberation.
* 🪨 **Stone‑Record:** Preserve key decisions in append‑only ledgers.

Seasonal cadence ❄️🌸☀️🍂: quarterly retros with zodiac flavors to review drift and repair culture debt.

## 4) Technical Enforcement (Policy‑as‑Code)

### 4.1 Transparency Envelope — JSON Schema

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://skybase/rules/transparency-envelope.schema.json",
  "title": "TransparencyEnvelope",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["intent", "provenance", "disclosures", "uncertainty"],
  "properties": {
    "intent": {"type": "string", "minLength": 3},
    "provenance": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "disclosures": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "uncertainty": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1},
    "consent_token": {"type": "string"},
    "links": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "format": "uri"}}
  }
}
```

**Header convention:**

```
X-Intent: <why this exists>
X-Disclosure: <affiliations, funding, conflicts>
X-Uncertainty: <0.0..1.0>
X-Consent: <hash or "n/a">
```

### 4.2 OPA / Rego Guardrail (sample)

```rego
package skybase.psyops

is_psyop[msg] {
  input.intent == "covert-influence"
  msg := "covert intent forbidden"
}

missing_envelope[msg] {
  not input.envelope
  msg := "transparency envelope missing"
}

violation[msg] { is_psyop[msg] }
violation[msg] { missing_envelope[msg] }

allow {
  not violation[_]
}
```

### 4.3 FastAPI Middleware (pseudocode)

```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def psyops_barrier(request, call_next):
    env = parse_transparency_envelope(request)
    if env is None:
        return JSONResponse({"error":"Missing Transparency Envelope"}, status_code=422)
    if env.intent.lower() in {"covert-influence", "manufacture-consensus"}:
        return JSONResponse({"error":"Psyops forbidden"}, status_code=451)
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Audit"] = stamp(env)
    return response
```

### 4.4 Bot/Brigade Detector (sketch)

* **Signals:** burst posting, synchronized creation times, stylometry collisions, graph modularity spikes, low entropy vocab, link‑farm loops.
* **Action:** –1 quarantine, 0 investigate (human), +1 release with transparent note.

---

## 5) Governance & Due Process

* **Ternary Review Board (TRB):** 3 seats = Rod (–1), Kernel (0), Staff (+1). Rotating stewards; quorum = 2.
* **Case Workflow:** Intake → Evidence pack → TRB triage → Decision → Public log.
* **Appeal:** fresh TRB, different members, publish rationale diffs.

**Public Ledger Fields (JSONL):** `case_id, who, what, when, evidence_hash, decision, rationale, moon_phase`

---

## 6) Incident Response (IR) Playbook

**Trigger:** suspected psyop signature.
**IR‑1:** Freeze: snapshot data, halt propagation (–1).
**IR‑2:** Tend: notify stakeholders, open thread with envelope (0).
**IR‑3:** Affirm: publish post‑mortem, ship patch, restore trust (+1).
**SLO:** 24h public note; 72h full post‑mortem with timelines.

---

## 7) Training & Rituals

* **Humor Shield Drills:** practice deflection without contempt.
* **Vagus Freedom Protocols:** breath cadence prompts, opt‑out macros, “right to silence” buttons.
* **Consent Writing:** every steward learns to craft envelopes and disclosures.

**Tanakh echoes:** Proverbs 3:5‑6; Leviticus 19:11; Psalm 118:16 — kept as cultural anchors.

---

## 8) Compliance Crosswalk (maps, not shackles)

* **NIST SP 800‑53:** PM‑1, RA‑3, AU‑6, IR‑4, PL‑4, AT‑2 mapped to logging, review boards, IR, training.
* **ISO/IEC 27001:** A.5 policies, A.7 HR security, A.12 operations, A.16 incidents.
* **EU DSA/GDPR:** transparency, consent, user rights honored via envelopes and opt‑outs.
* **Google SAIF:** governance, data transparency, red‑team readiness.
* **MIL‑STD‑498 (artifact discipline):** SSS, SRS, SDP, SVVP represented by this compendium + tests + ledgers.

---

## 9) Tests (Canaries & Checklists)

**Unit‑style checks:**

* `test_missing_envelope_rejected()`
* `test_covert_intent_blocked()`
* `test_optout_respected()`
* `test_audit_chain_unbroken()`

**Operational canaries:** seeded transparent posts verifying the barrier is alive; monthly red‑team drills (transparent by design) with public write‑ups.

---

## 10) Allowed vs. Not Allowed (Examples)

**Allowed (with Envelope):**

* “X‑Intent: recruit volunteers for garden build; X‑Disclosure: funded by RFI‑IRFOS; Uncertainty: 0.1.”

**Forbidden:**

* Botnet seeding “grassroots” praise; deepfake testimony without disclosure; doom‑funnel landing pages; engagement dark patterns.

---

## 11) Implementation Notes (Dev Tips)

* Ship default middleware in every service template.
* CI gate: block merges if test canaries fail.
* Dashboards: show live counts of envelopes, opt‑outs, IR tickets.

**Headers for UIs:** Clear “Why you’re seeing this,” live opt‑out toggle, link to raw sources.

---

## 12) Ritual Appendix — **Conflagration of the Psyops Golem** (symbolic)

1. **Name it** (🪨): write the tactic discovered.
2. **Unmask** (🌬️): speak its intent plainly.
3. **Witness** (💧): log it in the ledger with evidence.
4. **Burn** (🔥): announce the ban; deploy the patch; celebrate with humor.
5. **Ash to Soil** (🌲): compost the lesson into training materials.
6. **Seal** (✶): stamp with \[{(<𒀭>)}] and lunar phase.

> “By smooth words…” — Daniel 11:32. We choose strength + action, not deceit.

---

## 13) Versioning & Stewardship

* **SemVer:** `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with public changelog.
* **Stewards:** rotating TRB signers; keys stored with split knowledge.
* **Amendment rule:** must strengthen vagus freedom; no regressions.

---

## 14) Closing

△ pyramids collapse; ◯ circles breathe; ⬟ lattices endure.
**We set FIRE to the golem of psyops** and keep the vagus free.
