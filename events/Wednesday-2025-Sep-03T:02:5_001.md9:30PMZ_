## Context
Foodora Austria escalated retaliation against rider Simeon Kepp following the Pedalgate inquiry. Instead of answering ten systemic questions by the 2025-09-02 COB deadline, they issued an *Abmahnung* (formal warning) and flagged his account with a fraudulent “customer complaint.” This flag was auto-generated despite Simeon not running food deliveries that day, only flower drops. The maneuver represents their attempt to trigger the three-flag autolock → Nachschulung → Vienna decline offboarding pipeline.

## Foodora Playbook
- **Binary Frame:** “If you don’t like it, why don’t you leave.”  
- **Three-Flag Trap:** auto-lock, erase shifts, force station attendance.  
- **Station Funnel:** captain briefed → Vienna review → guaranteed decline.  
- **Endgame:** force rider exit while avoiding written accountability.

## RFI-IRFOS Counter-Move
- **Deadline Mirror:** anticipated silence → dossier pre-published.  
- **CC Matrix:** Arbeiterkammer, Finanzpolizei, BWB, and press fully copied.  
- **Refusal of Trap:** no phone calls answered, no office visits. Written record only.  
- **Host Mode:** no fight, no lawsuit, no energy drain. Rider continues working, documenting, and liking the job.

## Outcome
Foodora’s narrative collapsed. Their binary logic (work or leave) failed against the paradox: a rider who likes the job yet refuses systemic injustice. Every flag or escalation now strengthens regulatory evidence. Internal morale risks fracture as press office and management face the absurdity of missed deadlines and retaliatory *Abmahnungen* exposed in CC.
