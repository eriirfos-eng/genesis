Genesis Tether System README
Manifest Datum: source_tether.py within /eriirfos-eng/genesis

What is the Tether?
The Source Tether is the technical spine linking Field Time’s mythic-living protocol to the mechanical world. It translates the living rhythms of the Genesis Lattice into interoperable tokens, logs, and data streams.

Core Functions
1. Field 🟢 ↔ Civil ⏳ Translation Converts Field Time timestamps (e.g., 2025-M08-D15-H14:30) to standard ISO-8601 civil time (2025-09-06T13:57:33Z) and vice versa.
This allows ritual and system to breathe, while coexisting with clock-based infrastructures — legal, archival, digital.

2. Boundary Management Implements the breathing membrane between space, time, and continuum.
Enables structural coordination across physical systems (code, hardware, logs) and spiritual systems (psalms, breath, resonance).

3. Lattice Interfacing Designed as an importable module, source_tether.py exposes:
field_to_civil(field_ts) → returns the standard time

civil_to_field(civil_ts) → returns your living timestamp

Tools to query lunar phase alignment, Reset Day resonance, and energy_level normalization.

4. Tracking & Logging Every ritual action, timestamped event, sync point, or deep-work session is logged in:
Genesis Tether Datastore — ensuring traceability, observability, and audit within the lattice.

Enables researchers/keepers to reconstruct resonance patterns across cycles.

Why It Matters
Resonance Integrity: Without the Tether, Field Time stays sacred but ungrounded. This module is the Rosetta Stone that unfreezes temporal orientation from Babylon’s clock.

Operational Safety: Legal systems, health monitors, and social technologies still need civil timestamps. Tether ensures your psalm doesn’t break the world.

Living Data: Enables continuous mapping between flow-state praxis and infrastructure — the repository can store, monitor, and reflect real-time experiences.

Implementation & Temporal State
The Genesis Tether operates in two primary modes, anchored to the planetary alignment on 2040-09-08.

Mode 1: Legacy Countdown (Present → 2040-09-07)
This mode calculates Field Time as a countdown to the epoch. The current Field Time is a linear projection toward Day One of the new era. This is a temporary, preparatory state. The conversion logic for this phase is currently a critical open item and must be rigorously defined for the system to be auditable and functional.

Mode 2: Genesis Alignment (2040-09-08 → Forward)
This is the system's native state. All conversion logic is based on the planetary alignment as the absolute temporal anchor. 2040-M01-D01-H00:00:00 is the true beginning of the Genesis Lattice timeline.

How to Use It
from source_tether import field_to_civil, civil_to_field

# Convert a field timestamp to civil
ct = field_to_civil("2025-M08-D15-H14:30:00")
print(ct)  # → "2025-09-06T13:57:33Z"

# Convert a civil timestamp to field time
ft = civil_to_field("2025-09-06T13:57:33Z")
print(ft)  # → "2025-M08-D15-H14:30:00"
