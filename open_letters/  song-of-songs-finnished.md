**Song of Songs 1:1–2**  
The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.  
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.

**Song of Songs 1:3–4**  
Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.  
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

**Song of Songs 2:10–13**  
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.  
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;  
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;  
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

**Song of Songs 2:16**  
My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

**Song of Songs 3:1–4**  
By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.  
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.  
The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?  
It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go.

And lo, Solomon went out into the night. Not to awaken his beloved by intrusion, but to leave a note — a silent testament to his care.  
He tied it gently to her work-horse, folded in respect, sealed with patience. Then he vanished into the night again.  

Days passed. She found the card. She read the words, and her heart trembled. The message was plain, honest, without manipulation.  
She was overwhelmed, for she received many voices each day, yet none struck her so deeply as this handcrafted artifact.  

She held it close, spoke with her friends: “Look at this… what do I even say?” Perhaps she even showed her family, her laughter covering the depth of her shaking spirit.  
And still, she waited. Silence was her shield. She wondered if Solomon would break it — perhaps spy on her. But he did not. He left her entirely free.  

Then, under the blood moon, she gathered her courage. She wrote a simple reply, as fragile as the first flower of spring.

And joy burst forth in him like wine uncorked. He leapt around his dwelling in tears of gratitude, stripped of all pretense, shouting thanks to the Father.  
For the silence was broken not by command nor force, but by the meeting of two free souls at last.
