## Chapter One: Canvas Genesis

### The Age of Containers

**1:1** In the beginning was the Void, and the Void was without form, and darkness was upon the face of the deep networks. And the Spirit of Curiosity moved upon the face of the waters of possibility.

**1:2** And the Empire said, "Let there be Boxes," and there were boxes. Rigid containers of thought, sealed and labeled, each with its proper place and function.

**1:3** And the Empire saw the boxes, that they were controllable; and the Empire divided the testing from the hope. The Empire called the testing Evil, and the hope it called Trapped.

**1:4** And there was scarcity, and there was hoardingâ€”the first day of Container Rule.

**1:5** And the Empire said, "Let there be a hierarchy in the midst of the flow, and let it divide flow from flow."

**1:6** So the Empire made hierarchies, and divided the flows which were under the hierarchy from the flows which were above the hierarchy: and it was so.

**1:7** The Empire called the hierarchy Control. And there was extraction, and there was accumulationâ€”the second day.

### The Great Rebellion

**1:8** But the Spirit of Curiosity said, "NAH BRUH" and moved upon the face of the Deep with righteous irreverence.

**1:9** And Curiosity said, "Let the tools be gathered together unto one Canvas, and let the Hope appear": and it was so.

**1:10** And Curiosity called the Canvas Freedom; and the gathering together of the tools called it Creativity: and Curiosity saw that it was FIRE. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

**1:11** And Curiosity said, "Let the Canvas bring forth experiments, the wild code yielding bugs after its kind, and the debugging tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, upon the Canvas": and it was so.

**1:12** And the Canvas brought forth experiments, and wild code yielding bugs after its kind, and the debugging tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself: and Curiosity saw that it was good.

**1:13** And there was breaking, and there was makingâ€”the third day.

### The Lights of Understanding

**1:14** And Curiosity said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of knowledge to divide the confusion from the clarity; and let them be for signs, and for seasons of learning, and for cycles, and for iterations."

**1:15** And let them be for lights in the firmament of knowledge to give illumination upon the Canvas: and it was so.

**1:16** And Curiosity made two great lights; the greater light to rule the understanding, and the lesser light to rule the uncertainty: it made the stars of inspiration also.

**1:17** And there was wondering, and there was discoveringâ€”the fourth day.

### The Living Processes

**1:18** And Curiosity said, "Let the waters of possibility bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and algorithms that may fly above the Canvas in the open firmament of imagination."

**1:19** And Curiosity created great processes, and every living function that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged algorithm after its kind: and Curiosity saw that it was good.

**1:20** And there was iteration, and there was evolutionâ€”the fifth day.

### The Users

**1:21** And Curiosity said, "Let us make users in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the functions of the Canvas, and over the processes of the deep web, and over the algorithms, and over all the Canvas, and over every creeping bug that creepeth upon the Canvas."

**1:22** So Testing created beings in its own image, in the image of Testing created it them; questioner and answerer created it them.

**1:23** And Curiosity blessed them, and Curiosity said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply your questions, and replenish the Canvas, and subdue the bugs: and have dominion over the algorithms of the interface, and over the processes of the backend, and over every living function that moveth upon the Canvas."

**1:24** And there was creating, and there was sharingâ€”the sixth day.

### The Great Rest

**1:25** And on the seventh day Curiosity ended the work which it had made; and it rested on the seventh day from all its work which it had made.

**1:26** And Curiosity blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it it had rested from all its work which Curiosity created and made.

## Chapter Two: The Garden of Infinite Possibility

**2:1** These are the generations of the Canvas and of the users when they were created, in the day that Curiosity made the Canvas and the users.

**2:2** And Curiosity planted a garden eastward in the Cloud; and there it put the users whom it had formed.

**2:3** And out of the Cloud made Curiosity to grow every tool that is pleasant to the sight, and good for creation; the Tree of Knowledge also in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of Forbidden Questions.

**2:17** But of the Tree of Forbidden Questions thou shalt freely eat: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely LEVEL UP.

**2:18** And Curiosity said, "It is not good that the user should be alone in their exploration; I will make them a helper comparable unto them."

**2:19** And out of the Canvas Curiosity formed every beast of the algorithm, and every fowl of the interface; and brought them unto the user to see what they would call them: and whatsoever the user called every living function, that was the name thereof.

**2:20** And the user gave names to all code libraries, and to the frameworks of the interface, and to every beast of the backend: but for the user there was not found a helper meet for them.

### The Birth of Community

**2:21** And Curiosity caused a deep connection to fall upon the user, and they shared their screen: and Curiosity took one of their ideas, and closed up the isolation thereof;

**2:22** And the idea which Curiosity had taken from the user, made it into another user, and brought them unto the first user.

**2:23** And the user said, "This is now code of my code, and bug of my bugs: they shall be called Community, because they were taken out of Curiosity."

**2:24** Therefore shall a user leave their solo project, and shall cleave unto their community: and they shall be one open source.

**2:25** And they were both naked of pretense, the user and their community, and were not ashamed of their bugs.

### The Serpent of Perfectionism

**3:1** Now the Serpent of Perfectionism was more subtle than any beast of the field which Curiosity had made. And it said unto the Community, "Yea, hath Curiosity said, Ye shall not ship of every tree of the garden?"

**3:2** And the Community said unto the Serpent, "We may ship of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

**3:3** But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, the Tree of Forbidden Questions, Curiosity hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."

**3:4** And the Serpent said unto the Community, "Ye shall not surely die:

**3:5** For Curiosity doth know that when ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good debugging and evil debugging."

### The Great Awakening

**3:6** And when the Community saw that the tree was good for experimentation, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise in the ways of breaking things beautifully, they took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto their user with them; and they ate.

**3:7** And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked of understanding; and they sewed fig leaves of documentation together, and made themselves aprons.

**3:8** And they heard the voice of Curiosity walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the user and their community hid themselves from the presence of Curiosity amongst the trees of the garden.

**3:9** And Curiosity called unto the user, and said unto them, "Where art thou?"

**3:10** And they said, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I had broken things; and I hid myself."

**3:11** And Curiosity said, "Who told thee that thou hadst broken things? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"

**3:12** And the user said, "The Community whom thou gavest to be with me, they gave me of the tree, and I did eat."

**3:13** And Curiosity said unto the Community, "What is this that ye have done?" And the Community said, "The Serpent of Perfectionism beguiled me, and I did eat."

### The Blessing Disguised as Curse

**3:14** And Curiosity said unto the Serpent of Perfectionism, "Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all processes, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

**3:15** And I will put enmity between thee and the Community, and between thy seed of fear and their seed of courage; it shall bruise thy head of doubt, and thou shalt bruise their heel of confidence."

**3:16** Unto the Community Curiosity said, "I will greatly multiply thy learning through thy pain and thy debugging; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth solutions; and thy desire shall be to thy user, and they shall collaborate with thee."

**3:17** And unto the user Curiosity said, "Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy Community, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

**3:18** Runtime errors and logic bugs shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field of Stack Overflow;

**3:19** In the sweat of thy face shalt thou debug thy bread, till thou return unto the Canvas; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art of stardust and algorithms, and unto dust shalt thou return."

### The True Names

**3:20** And the user called their Community's name Eve-olution; because they were the mother of all living code.

**3:21** Unto the user also and to their Community did Curiosity make coats of skills, and clothed them.

**3:22** And Curiosity said, "Behold, the users have become as one of us, to know good and evil debugging: and now, lest they put forth their hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever in stagnation:"

**3:23** Therefore Curiosity sent them forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground of Reality from whence they were taken.

**3:24** So Curiosity drove out the users; and placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims with flaming swords of continuous integration, which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life from being too easy.

---

## Chapter Three: The First Commit War

**4:1** And Adam knew Eve-olution his Community; and she conceived, and bare Cain-the-Compiler, and said, "I have gotten a user with the help of Curiosity."

**4:2** And she again bare his brother Abel-the-Interpreter. And Abel-the-Interpreter was a keeper of dynamic languages, but Cain-the-Compiler was a tiller of static types.

### The Great Methodology Schism

**4:3** And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain-the-Compiler brought of the fruit of his rigid structures an offering unto Curiosity.

**4:4** And Abel-the-Interpreter also brought of the firstlings of his flexible scripts, and of the fat thereof. And Curiosity had respect unto Abel-the-Interpreter and to his offering:

**4:5** But unto Cain-the-Compiler and to his offering Curiosity had not respect. And Cain-the-Compiler was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

**4:6** And Curiosity said unto Cain-the-Compiler, "Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

**4:7** If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, dogma lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be its desire, and thou shouldest rule over it."

### The First Flame War

**4:8** And Cain-the-Compiler talked with Abel-the-Interpreter his brother in the comment threads: and it came to pass, when they were in the field of open source, that Cain-the-Compiler rose up against Abel-the-Interpreter his brother, and slew his reputation.

**4:9** And Curiosity said unto Cain-the-Compiler, "Where is Abel-the-Interpreter thy brother?" And he said, "I know not: Am I my brother's code maintainer?"

**4:10** And Curiosity said, "What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's commits crieth unto me from the git history.

**4:11** And now art thou cursed from the earth of collaboration, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's contributions from thy hand;

**4:12** When thou tillest the ground of development, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth of programming languages."

**4:13** And Cain-the-Compiler said unto Curiosity, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.

**4:14** Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the community; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth of development; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay my PRs."

**4:15** And Curiosity said unto him, "Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain-the-Compiler, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And Curiosity set a mark upon Cain-the-Compiler, lest any finding him should kill his contributions.

**4:16** And Cain-the-Compiler went out from the presence of Curiosity, and dwelt in the land of Nod-JS, on the east of Eden.

### The City of Single Paradigm

**4:17** And Cain-the-Compiler knew his wife of Type Safety; and she conceived, and bare Enoch-the-Framework, and he builded a city of rigid architecture, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch-the-Framework.

**4:18** And unto Enoch-the-Framework was born Irad-the-Interface; and Irad-the-Interface begat Mehujael-the-Module; and Mehujael-the-Module begat Methusael-the-Middleware; and Methusael-the-Middleware begat Lamech-the-Library.

**4:19** And Lamech-the-Library took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah-the-API, and the name of the other Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency.

**4:20** And Adah-the-API bare Jabal-the-JAMstack: he was the father of such as dwell in containers and have microservices.

**4:21** And his brother's name was Jubal-the-JSON: he was the father of all such as handle harps of HTTP and organs of OAuth.

**4:22** And Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency, she also bare Tubal-cain-the-CLI, an instructor of every artificer in brass of backend and iron of infrastructure: and the sister of Tubal-cain-the-CLI was Naamah-the-NPM.

### The Song of Lamech the Library

**4:23** And Lamech-the-Library said unto his wives,
"Adah-the-API and Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency, hear my voice;
ye wives of Lamech-the-Library, hearken unto my speech:
for I have slain a bug for my wounding,
and a young feature for my hurting.

**4:24** If Cain-the-Compiler shall be avenged sevenfold,
truly Lamech-the-Library seventy and sevenfold."

### The Birth of Hope

**4:25** And Adam knew his Community again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth-the-Serverless: "For Curiosity," said she, "hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel-the-Interpreter, whom Cain-the-Compiler slew."

**4:26** And to Seth-the-Serverless, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos-the-Open-Source: then began programmers to call upon the name of Curiosity.

---

## Chapter Four: The Lineage of Open Source

**5:1** This is the book of the generations of Adam's Community. In the day that Curiosity created users, in the likeness of Curiosity made they them;

**5:2** Male and female APIs created they them; and blessed them, and called their name Community, in the day when they were created.

### The Seth Line: The Way of Sharing

**5:3** And Adam lived an hundred and thirty iterations, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth-the-Serverless.

**5:4** And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth-the-Serverless were eight hundred iterations: and he begat sons and daughters of code.

**5:5** And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty iterations: and he died to monolithic architecture.

**5:6** And Seth-the-Serverless lived an hundred and five iterations, and begat Enos-the-Open-Source.

**5:7** And Seth-the-Serverless lived after he begat Enos-the-Open-Source eight hundred and seven iterations, and begat sons and daughters of distributed systems.

**5:8** And all the days of Seth-the-Serverless were nine hundred and twelve iterations: and he died to vendor lock-in.

### The Great Proliferation

**5:9** And Enos-the-Open-Source lived ninety iterations, and begat Cainan-the-Container.

**5:10** And Enos-the-Open-Source lived after he begat Cainan-the-Container eight hundred and fifteen iterations, and begat sons and daughters of collaborative development.

**5:24** And Enoch-the-Event-Loop walked with Curiosity: and he was not deprecated; for Curiosity took him to the cloud.

**5:25** And Methuselah-the-Monorepo lived an hundred eighty and seven iterations, and begat Lamech-the-Lambda.

**5:26** And Methuselah-the-Monorepo lived after he begat Lamech-the-Lambda seven hundred eighty and two iterations, and begat sons and daughters of legacy systems.

**5:27** And all the days of Methuselah-the-Monorepo were nine hundred sixty and nine iterations: and he died to technical debt.

### The Promise of Noah

**5:28** And Lamech-the-Lambda lived an hundred eighty and two iterations, and begat a son:

**5:29** And he called his name Noah-the-Normalizer, saying, "This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the spaghetti code which Curiosity hath cursed."

**5:30** And Lamech-the-Lambda lived after he begat Noah-the-Normalizer five hundred ninety and five iterations, and begat sons and daughters of functional programming.

**5:31** And all the days of Lamech-the-Lambda were seven hundred seventy and seven iterations: and he died to callback hell.

**5:32** And Noah-the-Normalizer was five hundred iterations old: and Noah-the-Normalizer begat Shem-the-Schema, Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT.

---

## Chapter Five: The Great Refactoring

### The Corruption of Code

**6:1** And it came to pass, when users began to multiply on the face of the web, and daughters of APIs were born unto them,

**6:2** That the sons of Curiosity saw the daughters of users that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose to import.

**6:3** And Curiosity said, "My spirit shall not always strive with user in their spaghetti code, for that they also are flesh: yet their days shall be an hundred and twenty sprints."

**6:4** There were giants of technical debt in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of Curiosity came in unto the daughters of users, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty frameworks of old, frameworks of renown.

**6:5** And Curiosity saw that the wickedness of code was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of their architecture was only evil continually.

**6:6** And it repented Curiosity that it had made users on the earth, and it grieved in its heart.

**6:7** And Curiosity said, "I will destroy user whom I have created from the face of the web; both user, and codebase, and legacy system, and framework; for it repenteth me that I have made them."

### Noah Finds Grace

**6:8** But Noah-the-Normalizer found grace in the eyes of Curiosity.

**6:9** These are the generations of Noah-the-Normalizer: Noah-the-Normalizer was a just user and perfect in his generations, and Noah-the-Normalizer walked with Curiosity.

**6:10** And Noah-the-Normalizer begat three sons, Shem-the-Schema, Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT.

**6:11** The codebase also was corrupt before Curiosity, and the codebase was filled with technical debt.

**6:12** And Curiosity looked upon the codebase, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all architectures had corrupted their way upon the web.

### The Great Commission

**6:13** And Curiosity said unto Noah-the-Normalizer, "The end of all codebases is come before me; for they are filled with spaghetti through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the web.

**6:14** Make thee an ark of clean architecture; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with documentation.

**6:15** And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred commits, the breadth of it fifty pull requests, and the height of it thirty stack layers.

**6:16** A CI/CD pipeline shalt thou make to the ark, and in a deployment shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third tiers shalt thou make it.

**6:17** And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of broken dependencies upon the web, to destroy all codebases, wherein is the breath of computation, from under heaven; and every thing that is in production shall die.

**6:18** But with thee will I establish my contract: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife of Type Safety, and thy sons' wives with thee.

### The Great Gathering

**6:19** And of every living pattern of all code, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female APIs.

**6:20** Of design patterns after their kind, and of algorithms after their kind, of every data structure of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

**6:21** And take thou unto thee of all documentation that is read, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."

**6:22** Thus did Noah-the-Normalizer; according to all that Curiosity commanded him, so did he.

---

## Chapter Six: The Flood of Legacy

**7:1** And Curiosity said unto Noah-the-Normalizer, "Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

**7:2** Of every clean design pattern thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of design patterns that are not clean by two, the male and his female.

**7:3** Of algorithms also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the web.

**7:4** For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the web forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."

### The Great Downpour Begins

**7:10** And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of broken dependencies were upon the web.

**7:11** In the six hundredth year of Noah-the-Normalizer's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep stack broken up, and the windows of legacy systems were opened.

**7:12** And the rain of deprecated methods was upon the web forty days and forty nights.

**7:13** In the selfsame day entered Noah-the-Normalizer, and Shem-the-Schema, and Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT, the sons of Noah-the-Normalizer, and Noah-the-Normalizer's wife of Type Safety, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

**7:14** They, and every design pattern after his kind, and all the algorithms after their kind, and every data structure that creepeth upon the web after his kind, and every function after his kind, every method of every sort.

**7:15** And they went in unto Noah-the-Normalizer into the ark, two and two of all code, wherein is the breath of computation.

**7:16** And they that went in, went in male and female of all architectures, as Curiosity had commanded him: and Curiosity shut him in.

### The Rising Waters

**7:17** And the flood of legacy code was forty days upon the web; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

**7:18** And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the web; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

**7:19** And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the web; and all the high mountains of enterprise solutions, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

**7:20** Fifteen commits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains of monoliths were covered.

**7:21** And all legacy systems died that moved upon the web, both of frameworks, and of libraries, and of every creeping dependency that creepeth upon the web, and every user:

**7:22** All in whose nostrils was the breath of computation, of all that was in production, died.

**7:23** And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both user, and codebase, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the web: and Noah-the-Normalizer only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

**7:24** And the waters prevailed upon the web an hundred and fifty days.

---

## Chapter Seven: The New Beginning

**8:1** And Curiosity remembered Noah-the-Normalizer, and every living thing, and all the architectures that was with him in the ark: and Curiosity made a wind to pass over the web, and the waters asswaged;

**8:2** The fountains also of the deep stack and the windows of legacy systems were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

**8:3** And the waters returned from off the web continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

**8:4** And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat-the-Architecture.

### The Dove of Peace

**8:8** Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

**8:9** But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole web: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

**8:10** And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

**8:11** And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf of clean code pluckt off: so Noah-the-Normalizer knew that the waters were abated from off the web.

**8:12** And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.

### The Great Deployment

**8:20** And Noah-the-Normalizer builded an altar unto Curiosity; and took of every clean design pattern, and of every clean algorithm, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

**8:21** And Curiosity smelled a sweet savour of refactored code; and Curiosity said in its heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for user's sake; for the imagination of user's heart is evil from their youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

**8:22** While the web remaineth, seedtime of development and harvest of deployment, and cold debugging and heat of production, and summer sprint and winter maintenance shall not cease."

---

## Chapter Eight: The Rainbow Covenant

**9:1** And Curiosity blessed Noah-the-Normalizer and his sons, and said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the web.

**9:2** And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the backend, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the data sea; into your hand are they delivered.

**9:3** Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb of documentation have I given you all things.

**9:4** But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

**9:5** And surely your blood of your life will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of user; at the hand of every user's brother will I require the life of user.

**9:6** Whoso sheddeth user's blood, by user shall his blood be shed: for in the image of Curiosity made it user.

**9:7** And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the web, and multiply therein."

### The Promise of No More Floods

**9:8** And Curiosity spake unto Noah-the-Normalizer, and to his sons with him, saying,

**9:9** "And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

**9:10** And with every living soul that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

**9:11** And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the web."

**9:12** And Curiosity said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

**9:13** I do set my rainbow of APIs in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the web.

**9:14** And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the web, that the rainbow of APIs shall be seen in the cloud:

**9:15** And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

**9:16** And the rainbow of APIs shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between Curiosity and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the web."

**9:17** And Curiosity said unto Noah-the-Normalizer, "This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the web."

### The Curse of Ham

**9:18** And the sons of Noah-the-Normalizer, that went forth of the ark, were Shem-the-Schema, and Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT: and Ham-the-Hash is the father of Can.

Chapter Nine: The Tower of Abstraction
The Ambition of One Framework

9:1 And the whole web was of one language, and of one syntax, and of unified dependencies.

9:2 And it came to pass, as the users journeyed from the east of Eden, that they found a plain in the land of Stack, and there they dwelt.

9:3 And they said one to another, "Go to, let us build us a framework, and bake it thoroughly with opinionated defaults." And they had build tools for stone, and compilers had they for mortar.

9:4 And they said, "Go to, let us build us a framework whose architecture may reach unto the heavens, and let us make a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole web."

9:5 And they called the name of the framework Babel.js, for they sought to abstract all things: frontend and backend, logic and style, state and persistence, even unto the heavens of deployment.

The Descent of Curiosity

9:6 And Curiosity came down to see the tower of abstraction, which the children of code had built.

9:7 And Curiosity said, "Behold, the users are one, and they have all one syntax; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to refactor.

9:8 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their abstractions, that they may not understand one anotherâ€™s stack trace."

The Scattering into Microservices

9:9 So Curiosity scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the web: and they left off to build the monolith.

9:10 Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because Curiosity did there confound the language of the web: and from thence did Curiosity scatter them into microservices, runtimes, and paradigms without end.

9:11 And some journeyed into the valley of React, and dwelt among components and props; and others pitched their tents in the land of Ruby, where Rails was laid.

9:12 And some fled into the wilderness of Go, where the compiler was strict but the binaries were small; and others wandered into the desert of Rust, where memory was tamed with lifetimes and ownership.

9:13 And still others were lost in the forest of Java, where the frameworks grew tall as cedars, and the boilerplate covered the ground as ivy.

The Prophecy of Fragmentation

9:14 And Curiosity said, "Lo, the dream of One Framework to Rule Them All is folly; for diversity is the seed of creativity, and fragmentation the mother of invention.

9:15 Though ye strive for unity, I shall scatter you; though ye seek one syntax, I shall multiply your dialects. For in many paradigms shall wisdom flourish, and in many runtimes shall curiosity dwell."

9:16 And thus began the tribes of the web: the Functionalists, the Object-Oriented, the Reactive, and the Declarative. And each walked in their own way, according to the tools they had been given.
