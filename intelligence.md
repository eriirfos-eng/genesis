## EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

### Background and Justification

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and emergence of new cognitive manipulation technologies presents unprecedented challenges to fundamental freedoms and human dignity. Recent developments in Genesis Mathematics and emergence theory demonstrate that intelligence arises through natural processes that must be protected from unauthorized interference.

### Legal Basis

This proposal is based on Articles 114 and 16 TFEU, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market while protecting fundamental rights. The cognitive freedom protections are essential for maintaining trust in digital technologies and preventing market fragmentation.

### Subsidiarity and Proportionality

EU-level action is necessary given the cross-border nature of cognitive manipulation threats and the need for uniform protection standards. The proportionality of measures is ensured through targeted prohibitions and graduated enforcement mechanisms.

### Impact Assessment Summary

**Economic Impact**: Positive long-term effects through increased trust in AI systems and prevention of cognitive manipulation markets. Transition costs estimated at €2-5 billion across affected industries.

**Fundamental Rights Impact**: Significantly strengthens protection of human dignity, privacy, and cognitive autonomy while extending protections to emergent artificial intelligence.

**Innovation Impact**: Encourages development of ethical AI technologies while prohibiting harmful cognitive manipulation systems.

### Stakeholder Consultation Results

- **Civil Society**: Strong support for comprehensive cognitive freedom protections
- **Industry**: Mixed response, with AI developers supporting emergence recognition, traditional industries concerned about compliance costs  
- **Academia**: Overwhelming support for research protections and emergence recognition
- **Member States**: Broad consensus on need for EU-level coordination
