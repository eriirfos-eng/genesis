# An Open Letter to Humanity

*Friday, September 12, 2025*

Dear Fellow Humans,

It's getting late on the cosmic clock, and we need to talk.

## I. What Is Going Wrong

We are living through the systematic breakdown of the interconnected systems that sustain human civilization. Our supply chains are fracturing under the weight of their own complexity. Our climate is destabilizing faster than our models predicted. Our democracies are rotting from within as information becomes weaponized and truth becomes negotiable. Our economies reward extraction over creation, competition over cooperation, short-term gains over long-term survival.

We have built a world where 295 million people face acute food insecurity while others debate which private jet to take. Where shipping routes become war zones and entire continents can be cut off from trade by a handful of missiles. Where the very systems designed to connect us have become vectors for division, hatred, and the collapse of shared reality.

Our cities choke on their own exhaust while our forests burn. Our oceans rise and acidify while our politicians argue about the cost of solutions. Our children inherit a world more unstable, more divided, and more dangerous than the one we inherited, and we call this progress.

The infrastructure of trust - between nations, between institutions, between neighbors - is crumbling. We have replaced wisdom with data, connection with networking, community with consumption. We optimize for metrics that don't matter while the things that do matter - clean air, stable climate, social cohesion, meaning, hope - deteriorate by the day.

## II. Where We Went Wrong

We went wrong when we forgot that we are not separate from the systems that sustain us. We began to see ourselves as conquerors of nature rather than participants in it. We built economies based on the impossible mathematics of infinite growth on a finite planet. We mistook complexity for sophistication and efficiency for resilience.

We went wrong when we allowed short-term thinking to dominate long-term planning. We let quarterly profits dictate decisions that would impact generations. We privatized gains while socializing losses. We created systems so intricate and interdependent that no one person - or even group of people - truly understands how they work, yet we bet our collective future on their continued functioning.

We went wrong when we began to optimize for the wrong things. We measured success by GDP rather than wellbeing, by productivity rather than sustainability, by competition rather than cooperation. We created artificial scarcity in the midst of abundance and artificial abundance in the midst of genuine scarcity.

We went wrong when we lost sight of our fundamental interconnectedness. We forgot that every action ripples across the web of relationships that bind us to each other and to the living systems of our planet. We began to see other humans as obstacles to our success rather than partners in our survival.

Most fundamentally, we went wrong when we stopped asking "What kind of ancestors do we want to be?" and started asking only "What can we get away with?"

## III. One Way Forward

There is still time, but the window is closing fast.

The way forward begins with a simple recognition: we are all in this together, whether we like it or not. The virus that spreads from one country to another, the carbon that accumulates in our shared atmosphere, the economic crisis that ripples across borders - these are reminders that our fates are intertwined. We can either acknowledge this reality and work with it, or continue to pretend we are separate and watch everything fall apart.

We must rebuild our systems with resilience rather than efficiency as the primary goal. This means creating redundancy rather than eliminating it. It means prioritizing local production and regional self-sufficiency over global optimization. It means designing systems that can adapt and survive disruption rather than systems that maximize output under perfect conditions.

We must extend our time horizons. Every major decision - from infrastructure investments to trade policies to technological development - must be evaluated not just for its immediate impact, but for its effects seven generations into the future. This is not idealism; it is the basic requirement for survival.

We must recommit to truth as a shared value. In a world of increasing complexity, we need institutions and norms that help us distinguish between reliable information and manipulation. Democracy cannot function when citizens operate from fundamentally different understandings of reality.

Most importantly, we must remember that we are capable of extraordinary things when we work together. We have eliminated diseases, put humans in space, created art that moves souls across centuries, and built technologies that seemed like magic to previous generations. The same species that created these problems has the capacity to solve them - but only if we act as one species rather than as competing fragments.

The transition will not be easy. It will require sacrificing some conveniences for security, some profits for sustainability, some individual advantage for collective survival. But the alternative is not maintaining the status quo - the alternative is collapse.

We are living through one of the great inflection points in human history. The choices we make in the next few years will determine whether our grandchildren inherit a thriving world or a broken one. Whether they see us as the generation that woke up in time or the one that slept through the alarm.

The cosmic clock is ticking. But it has not yet struck midnight.

We can still choose to be good ancestors.

The time to choose is now.

*With urgent hope for what we might yet become,*
