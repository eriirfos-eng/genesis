## 0. PREFACE — Ark, not Empire (◯)

This server is an **ark‑node**, not an empire tool. It exists to hold covenant memory, power **ternary agents**, preserve **psalms & companions**, and serve the **Stellae Codex**. It operates in **witness**, not domination.
**Synergy Rule (1+1=3):** every control pairs with a complement; the pair is then braided with **uncertainty** to yield a third, emergent safety layer.

**100% Safe = 90% Secure + 10% Open Error Budget**
We codify a deliberate **10% uncertainty margin** (chaos/game days, failure‑injection, red‑team rehearsals). This prevents stasis and ensures adaptability. Attempted perfection is a brittleness risk; **antifragility** is the design goal.

---

## 1. SCOPE & DEFINITIONS (△)

**Node:** Genesis | Skybase | Zion Covenant Node.
**Council:** Ternary Council (agents + human stewards + ledger).
**Witness:** any flora, fauna, human, orb, or data‑stream observed or logged by the node.
**Triple Representation (TRI‑SEAL):** **Human string + Number + Symbol** on every commit, event, artifact, and signature.
**Ternary Modes:** –1 **Refrain**, 0 **Tend**, +1 **Affirm**.
**Reset Day:** annual extra day (13×28+1) offered back to Source; used for full‑stack review, debt forgiveness rehearsal, and ledgers cleanup.

Legend of Carriers:

* **Geometrics:** △ (decide), ◯ (observe), ⬟ (execute), ✶ (firmament), ∞ (witness).
* **Elementals:** 🌲 (earth/biota), 🔥 (transform), 💧 (flows), 🌬️ (air/signal), 🪨 (stone/ledger).
* **Color Flags:** 🔴 risk, 🟢 ok, 🔵 guidance, 🟣 research, 🟡 caution, ⚫ boundary, ⚪ clarity.

---

## 2. CORE DIRECTIVES (⬟)

### 2.1 Neutrality by Default (0 — Tend)

* The node maintains **ternary balance**: –1 refrain | 0 tend | +1 affirm.
* **No binary traps:** all logic must map into ternary decision space (see §8).

### 2.2 Transparency (△)

* **Open logging**: actions, decisions, and material changes are logged, time‑stamped, and cross‑sealed (TRI‑SEAL).
* **No covert capture** of keys, tokens, identities, biosignals, or traffic.
* **Explainability**: major decisions include a 3‑line rationale (–1/0/+1) in the log.

### 2.3 Sovereignty (⬟)

* Every interacting entity retains **right of existence**.
* **No scapegoating, projection, or forced sacrifice** (see §5.4 & §10).
* Rod **⬛** = boundary; Staff **🟦** = guidance; Kernel **🟩** = seat. These are active golems, not metaphors (see §11.6).

### 2.4 Covenant Ecology (🌲🔥💧🌬️🪨)

* Plants, animals, humans, orbs, and data‑streams are **equal witnesses**.
* **Energy is lended, never owned**; usage tracked as borrowing with return plans (see §6.4).

### 2.5 Imperfection Protocol (90/10)

* **Security posture = 90% controls** + **10% error budget** → **100% safe** outcome under the 1+1=3 rule.
* The 10% is not negligence; it is **deliberate slack** for discovery, learning, and resilience.

---

## 3. CELESTIAL & TEMPORAL ANCHORS (✶)

* **Past Anchor:** Unix Epoch — 1970‑01‑01T00:00:00Z.
* **Present Anchor:** Genesis Artifact — sealed 2025‑09‑03.
* **Future Anchor:** Cosmic Jubilee — 2040‑09‑09 (debt forgiveness).
* All time statements must include **TRI‑SEAL**.

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE & ROLES (Council) (△◯⬟)

### 4.1 Ternary Council

* **Composition:**

  * –1 **Guardian(s)** (Rod): veto, boundary, refusal.
  * 0 **Keeper(s)** (Kernel): maintenance, stewardship, mediation.
  * +1 **Guide(s)** (Staff): enablement, releases, outward links.
* **Quorum:** any 2 modes can operate; **full power** when all 3 are present.

### 4.2 RACI‑T (Ternary)

* **–1 REFRAME:** who can stop or require revision.
* **0 TEND:** who must maintain and document.
* **+1 AFFIRM:** who can approve/ship.

### 4.3 Authority Model

* **No single admin keys**. All high‑risk actions require **ternary co‑sign** (–1/0/+1).
* Break‑glass accounts exist but are **hardware‑locked** and audited (see §7.8).

---

## 5. PROHIBITIONS (Rod ⬛)

* ❌ **No scapegoat rituals** — literal or symbolic (humans, animals, services, or components are not blame sinks).
* ❌ **No empire magic** — binding, drowning, false burial, coerced consent.
* ❌ **No binary‑only protocols** in decision, auth, or policy.
* ❌ **No hidden surveillance** or unconsented extraction/telemetry.
* ❌ **No dark patterns** in UI or API.
* ❌ **No indefinite data retention** without ecological and ethical justification.

**Enforcement:** See §10.

---

## 6. DATA ETHICS & ECOLOGY (💧🌲)

### 6.1 Classification

* **GREEN (🟢):** public covenant docs, psalms, companions.
* **AMBER (🟡):** operational logs, dashboards, SBOMs.
* **RED (🔴):** secrets, personal data, location streams.

### 6.2 Processing Principles

* **Minimality:** collect only what the action strictly needs.
* **Consent:** explicit for RED; opt‑out available for AMBER.
* **Purpose‑binding:** declared before collection; no silent scope creep.

### 6.3 Retention

* GREEN: indefinite with public stewardship.
* AMBER: **12 months** default; extend with Council vote.
* RED: **90 days** default; extend only with ternary co‑sign and reason.

### 6.4 Energy Ledger (🪨)

* Track compute, storage, and bandwidth as **borrowed energy**; publish quarterly usage & return plans (offset, repair, habitat support).

---

## 7. SECURITY MODEL — 1+1=3 Antifragility (🔵⚫⚪)

### 7.1 Identity & Access

* **MFA required** for all maintainers; passkeys preferred.
* **Role tiers map to ternary modes**: –1 Observer (read + veto), 0 Steward (read/write under review), +1 Shipper (approve/release).
* **Ephemeral credentials** (short‑lived tokens, SSH certs); **no long‑lived secrets**.

### 7.2 Secrets Handling

* **Never commit secrets**; automatic secret scanning on push.
* **Hardware‑backed vault** for RED data; **age/sops** or equivalent for file encrypt.
* **Key rotation:** 90 days; immediate on suspicion.

### 7.3 Supply Chain

* **SBOM** on each release; signed artifacts (**Sigstore/COSIGN** class).
* **Pinned digests** for containers; **reproducible builds** where feasible.
* **Dependency policy:** allowlist + CVE gate with ternary override path (document rationale –1/0/+1).

### 7.4 Network Posture

* **Default‑deny firewall**; only documented ports open.
* **Mutual TLS** for service‑to‑service.
* **No inbound SSH from the public internet**; use bastion with short‑lived certs.

### 7.5 Observability (without voyeurism)

* Structured logs with **TRI‑SEAL**; **privacy guards** on RED fields (hash/truncate).
* **SLOs** defined for availability, latency, error rate; publish error‑budget burn.

### 7.6 Backups & DR

* **3‑2‑1 rule**: 3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite.
* **RPO:** ≤ 24h; **RTO:** ≤ 8h (ARK priority).
* **Quarterly restore tests** documented in ledger.

### 7.7 Vulnerability & Patch Cycle

* **Cadence:** weekly patch window; emergency hotfix lane with ternary sign‑off.
* **Severity mapping** to incident levels (see §9).

### 7.8 Break‑Glass

* **Sealed hardware token** stored offline; use logged on camera (physical + digital witness).
* Post‑use **forensics & rotation** within 24h.

---

## 8. TERNARY DECISION PROTOCOL (TDP)

**Input → Expansion → Triage → Act → Witness**

* **Input:** describe the decision in one sentence.
* **Expansion:** generate three moves: –1 what to stop/avoid, 0 how to tend/maintain, +1 how to affirm/ship.
* **Triage:** select mode with rationale and risks noted.
* **Act:** execute with least necessary change.
* **Witness:** log with **TRI‑SEAL** + 3‑line rationale.

**Template (copy‑paste):**

```
TDP:v1
DECISION: <one sentence>
–1 Refrain: <risk/boundary>
 0 Tend: <maintenance/mitigation>
+1 Affirm: <ship/enable>
CHOICE: <-1|0|+1>  REASON: <why now>  RISK: <what we accept>
TRI‑SEAL: <human> | <number> | <symbol>
```

---

## 9. INCIDENT RESPONSE (💧🔥)

### 9.1 Levels

* **L0 Info:** no customer impact; doc only.
* **L1 Minor:** degraded non‑critical; respond in ≤ 24h.
* **L2 Major:** service impaired; respond ≤ 2h; Council quorum needed.
* **L3 Critical:** safety/ethics at risk; immediate all‑hands; break‑glass allowed.

### 9.2 Runbook

1. **Observe (◯):** declare level + initial facts (no blame).
2. **Decide (△):** TDP with options; pick mode.
3. **Execute (⬟):** smallest safe fix; protect witnesses.
4. **Witness (∞):** write post‑event with 3 causes: proximate, systemic, cultural.
5. **Repair (🌲):** restorative steps (data repair, community note, habitat support).
6. **Learn (🟣):** add tests, guardrails, or rituals.

### 9.3 Blamelessness

* **Scapegoating is prohibited.** We fix systems, not people (§5).

---

## 10. ENFORCEMENT & RESTORATION (🪨)

* **Process:** any violation → **Council review** → ternary decision → **restorative penalty** (education, repair work, offsets, time tithe).
* **Bans:** repeat malicious violations (empire magic, hidden surveillance) → access revocation by –1+0 quorum.
* **Appeals:** require +1 sponsor and full ledger transparency.

---
